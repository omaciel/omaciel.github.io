      <description>Starting today I will be stuck attending some training class for work. These &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; start at 9am and end at 4:30pm, all through Friday! Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to grab a cup of coffee in the next 5 minutes. Managed to update this blog to WordPress 1.5.1. Since this was a bux-fixing release, don&amp;rsquo;t expect to find anything changed here.
As a side note, am looking forward to some WoW playing time with Vinny tonight!</description>

      <description>Last night I decided to work on my plan of racking up World of Warcraft hours in order to beef up my character but since my friend Vinny was busy with his own quests, I decided to try my newly learned skill: fishing! As stupid as this may sound, I never thought that fishing in a game could be so&amp;hellip; relaxing! I switched my character&amp;rsquo;s sword for a fishing pole and spent a good 15 minutes casting the line and watching the bobber.</description>

      <title>Game Night</title>

      <description>Last night was my weekly night to play games with my friend Vinny. I have been playing Enemy Territory every Wednesday night since last Summer with a few cancellations here and there. Earlier this year Vinny convinced me to try World of Warcraft, a very addictive online multiplayer game. I was hooked from the start but not being able to &amp;ldquo;dedicate&amp;rdquo; to more than a couple of hours a week I eventually lost interest.</description>

      <description>Every Wednesday night has been &amp;ldquo;Enemy Territory Night&amp;rdquo; for Vinny and I for quite some time now. I&amp;rsquo;m a confessed E.T. addict and have been known for taking just any free second I can squeeze out of my tight daily agenda just so I can play a little bit. Tonight is the only time during the week when I can forego my house chores so I can solely concentrate on the game.</description>
