      <description>Growing up my dad used to tell me that there are three important milestones on a manâ€™s life (though I feel that the same could be said about any gender):
 Plant a tree Have a child Write a book  Through my life, I have planted quite a few trees, including a lemon and papaya tree I used to treat as my imaginary friends :)
I have also had the highest honor to be the father to three amazing girls!</description>

      <description>First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love being a Quality Engineer, something that I have been doing for a living for the last 11 years of my life! During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</description>

      <description>Took some time from my vacation and released FauxFactory 0.3.0 to make it Python 3 compatible and to add a new generate_utf8 method (plus some nice tweaks and code clean up).
As always, the package is available on Pypi and can be installed via pip install fauxfactory.
If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug report or feature request, please use the Github page.</description>

      <description>Short on its heels, today I&#39;m releasing FauxFactory 0.2.1 to fix a brown paper bag bug I encountered last night before going to bed.
Basically, the new &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; generator was not honoring the words parameter if you asked for a string longer than 70 characters. I have fixed the issue as well as added a new test to make sure that the generator does the right thing.
The package is available on Pypi (sadly the page is still not rendering correctly.</description>

      <description>Today I&#39;m releasing FauxFactory 0.2.0 with a new feature, a &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; generator. I confess that I did not look around for any existing implementation in python out there and just started writing code. My idea was to create a method that would:
Return a &amp;quot;Lorem Ipsum&amp;quot; string if I passed no arguments:
In [1]: from fauxfactory import FauxFactory In [2]: FauxFactory.generate_iplum() Out[2]: u&amp;#39;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</description>
