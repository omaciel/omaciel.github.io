                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Recently MeetUp, a then free group organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay $19 a month to use their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for the Northern NJ Linux Meetup I&rsquo;m somewhat saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean the end of the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we&rsquo;ve had so far (with the exception of the day I brought someone from Ubuntu Linux to gives us a talk&hellip; that day we had 7 members!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Ever since MeetUp announced they would start charging groups money to use their free service, I started thinking of possible alternatives to keep the Northern NJ Linux Meetup group alive. I understand that everyone is entitled to make a living but I don&rsquo;t agree with their decision of making this drastic change of heart without any warnings. I have spoken to some people and read some posts/comments online and came to the conclusion that the smaller groups will most likely vanish in the turmoil.</div>

He was kind enough to accept my invitation to visit and tell us about his work with Ubuntu and Debian Linux. I think everyone had a good time! Mako seems to be a really nice guy and was more than willing to answer our questions.</div>

I have arranged for Benjamin Mako Hill, Debian and Ubuntu Linux package maintaner/contributer, to attend our next Northern New Jersey Meetup meeting this Monday 11th, 2005! I have asked him to talk about Ubuntu Linux and also his involvement with Debian. This should be a very interesting meeting for everyone and I urge everyone to show up! Make sure to reserve your spot so I have a good idea of how many people will be present.</div>

I arrived earlier than everybody else despite the really bad traffic on Route 4 West. The place was really crowded and I couldn&rsquo;t set up my laptop at the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; place by the conference room. I ended up going to the couch by the front entrance. Armed with a hot cup of coffee I proceeded to get boot my laptop and get some internet going&hellip; About 15 minutes later I realized something fishy was going on with the free wifi for I just could not get a working IP assigned.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Following up on a previous post, my good friend Steve Goguen has officially registered The Northern NJ Open Source Alliance. It will be an attempt to bring all the other &ldquo;geeky&rdquo; MeetUp groups from Northern New Jersey together into a an unified one. We should hear back soon from some of the other MeetUp organizers and work something out. I think the goal is to schedule all our individual meetings to coincide on the same dates.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This past Monday I hosted the monthly Northern New Jersey Linux Meetup at Panera Bread. It is the 7th meeting I have organized ever since taken over the group back in September 2004. I managed to get there earlier than usual and took advantage of the extra time to write down some ideas I had for a new pet project of mine and get some good coffee. One hour later some of the frequent attendees arrived.</div>
