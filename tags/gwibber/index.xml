      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Ping.FM to update my Twitter and Identi.ca accounts for the last 2 weeks. That is all good and great but I needed a way to read the replies and feeds from those 2 accounts as well! My &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; was to keep 3 tabs open in my browser and periodically refresh those pages to see if there was anything new. In comes Gwibber. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until last night that I found out we had it packaged in our repositories (the WebKit branch) so today I decided to give it a go.</description>
