      <description>I can finally talk about my great news: I&amp;rsquo;m going back to school this Fall! Everyone who knows me well knows how much I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to be a Tar Heel! There is something about the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill that makes me feel like this is where I belong. From the very first time I came here I fell in love with the place, people and places and I knew right there and then that one day I&amp;rsquo;d be calling it home some day.</description>
