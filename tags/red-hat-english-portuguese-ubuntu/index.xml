      <description>English:Â My Red Hat took me and the kids to the NC Museum of Art this last Sunday! It was perfect too as we got to see a lot of the exhibits and still managed to find time to eat at Lilly&amp;rsquo;s. Did you know that the entrance is free and the museum is sponsored by the State of North Carolina for our viewing and learning pleasure? Take that NYC and your extremely expensive entrance fees!</description>
