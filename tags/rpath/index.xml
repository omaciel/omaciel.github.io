      <description>Passados 51 episódios, neste último sábado o Castálio Podcast completou 2 anos! Foram muitas entrevistas super divertidas, animadas e prá lá de interessantes com pessoas representando vários projetos e áreas de trabalho! Para comemorar, decidi atender aos pedidos de alguns ouvintes e fazer mais uma entrevista&amp;hellip; comigo mesmo! A primeira vez foi quando ainda não havia um formato definido e, para falar a verdade, eu não pesava que ia conseguir levar o projeto para frente por tanto tempo.</description>

      <description>Este último dia 5 de fevereiro recebi a seguinte mensagem por e-mail:
 Congratulations for reaching 90 days of service with Red Hat!
 É difícil de acreditar que já se passaram 3 meses desde que eu comecei este novo capítulo na minha carreira! Meus dias têm sido preenchidos com tantas novidades que isso talvez ajude a explicar porque parece que foi somente ontem que eu sai da rPath para ingressar na equipe CloudForms QE aqui na Red Hat!</description>

      <description>This past Feb. 5th I was greeted early in the morning with the following email:
 Congratulations for reaching 90 days of service with Red Hat!
 It is hard for me to believe that it has been 3 months already since I started this new chapter in my career! My days have been filled with so many new things that it may explain why it literally feels like it was only yesterday that I left rPath to join the CloudForms QE Team here at Red Hat!</description>

      <description>Last October I celebrated a couple of milestones in my life:
 5 years living in North Carolina; 2 years since I bought my first house; 11 years married to my wife; 5 years working for rPath;  Needless to say, each one of those milestones were very important to me as they mark important decision points in my life! Every single one of them changed my life for the better and I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel blessed that I have so many things to look forward to at end of the year that remind me how lucky I have been!</description>

Cada um deles mudou a minha vida para melhor e eu me sinto abençoado por ter tantas coisas para celebrar no final do ano que me fazem lembrar o quão sortudo eu tenho sido!</description>

      <description>This is more of a &amp;ldquo;feel good&amp;rdquo; post, mostly for me! Through my life I have come across a fork on the road many times, and for the last 4+ years I have always chosen the path to the right. Even when the left side sometimes looked a bit more &amp;ldquo;paved&amp;rdquo; and less difficult to walk through, I still chose the right path! The reasons are many, but I think I can distill them into one single sentence: I believe!</description>

      <description>It was around the end of 2006. Having spent most of my life living in the New Jersey - New York axis and close to my family, I bought a one-way ticket to RDU, packed my bag (yeah, one bag) and came down to North Carolina looking for a new job. Leaving my wife (who was expecting our second child) and young daughter while I went &amp;ldquo;job spelunking&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy for me, but I was determined to quit the rat race once and for all!</description>

Once again, this alpha release is from our QA branch, and is intended mostly to receive feedback on brand new installs from end-users, specially in relation to the overall behavior of X.org on first boot! Obviously, if you&amp;rsquo;re already running Foresight Linux 2.5.0 ALPHA1, simply update your system from the command line: *sudo conary updateall*</description>

      <description>This year I decided to do something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a very long time: get my own private Linux server! A place where I could have total control (i.e. root access) and be able to install or run anything I wanted! Better yet, I wanted a conary managed system that could leverage all the packaging that I have already done for Foresight Linux and be dead simple to maintain!</description>

      <description>It is with my Community Manager hat and as a Linux enthusiast that I bring you this post about the Foresight Linux distribution, literally born and brewed where I work and filled to the brim with the technology developed at rPath. However, this is not yet another article about yet another Linux distribution with arguments about how great it is compared to other popular ones out there. No siree Bob! In fact, if you are happy with the platform or distribution that you are running, then kudos to you!</description>

 Brand New Translation Storage Engine QT (TS) translation file format support Source language file tracking over HTTP Translation file metadata auto-updating Clone language Non-English Source Languages Lotte: Multiple Source Languages, Suggestions, Keyboard Shortcuts, Translation Memory Application Programmable Interface  Can you believe that Transifex has reached the 1.</description>

      <description>If you remember one of my last posts, I wanted to eventually migrate my Django Developer Kit Appliance to use Foresight Linux as the underlying operating system&amp;hellip; and I am proud to announce that I have made huge strides toward this goal!
Thanks to the guidance of some fellow rPathians, I managed to get an almost ready for production Django 1.2.3 + PostgreSQL 8.4 + Python 2.6.2 and lots of Django modules and latest versions for Git, Mercurial, Bzr, and Subversion ready to be used!</description>

      <description>No, this is not a repeat from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post. Turns out there was another security release for Django yesterday (thanks Zygmunt for the heads up), so here&amp;rsquo;s the release of Django Developer Kit Appliance 1.2.3.

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m releasing my Django Developer Kit Appliance 1.2.2 due to the recent security release of Django 1.2.2. Other than a newer version of Django, you&amp;rsquo;ll also get newer versions of several packages already included by default in the appliance.
I have been working hard (time permitting, off course) on migrating the appliance to a slim Foresight Linux base in order to upgrade the underlying python from 2.4 to latest 2.</description>

      <description>This post has been sitting in my Drafts folder for a while now, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure when the right time would be to publish it. It is basically my personal reflection on the last 5 years I have worked doing translations for free and open source software (FOSS) and a few lessons I learned along the way. It is also a rant against those who took my labor for granted.</description>

 Last night our Transifex installation turned 1 year old. I think with 101 users and 4012 submissions in 45 languages it has been quite a step forward compared to the previous mailing list-based submission system. For that I&#39;d like to thank all the people involved, most noticeably Jannis for the initial setup, the Transifex guys for help and fixing bugs, Og for the appliance we&#39;ve been running for the last half year and of course the Translators with all their patience and effort to make it a success.</description>

 Whatâ€™s new with Radio Tray?  http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1016Radio Tray, your favorite light weight online radio streaming application, has gone under some more development churn since its last release. Namely, there is now aÂ dbus interface to allow other applications to interact with it!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to announce the release of my Django Developer Kit 1.2 RC1! The highlights for this release include the first Release Candidate for the upcoming Django 1.2, as well as a switch of the underlying platform, from CentOS to rPath Linux 2. All kinks have been worked out and setting up a Django-based project in the appliance is a piece of cake! Some of the Django modules included are:</description>

      <description>Got a couple of interesting bits for you today, starting with some really great news from the Hamster Project, a time tracking application. My friend Tom wrote about his recent work decoupling the communication layer from the client and the back-end, which will now be handled by dbus. What that really means is that it will be easier to script against hamster and tap into the data that it captures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple code sample from Tom&amp;rsquo;s page:</description>

Anyone who has ever added a project to BitBucket already knows what Mercurial is, but for those who have never heard about it, &amp;ldquo;it is a free, distributed source control managemt tool that can efficiently handle projects of any size and offers an easy and intuitive interface.&amp;rdquo; In other words, in the world of Distributed Version Control (Systems), or DVCS or short, Mercurial is the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees!</description>

Announcing my first attempt at a generic Django Developer Kit, a CentOS (powered by rPath&#39;s conary) based software appliance with all you&#39;d need to run a Django project.

      <description>Just wanted to update everyone who showed interest in the new release of GNOME Developer Kit I announced yesterday. Based on some preliminary statistics I collected in the (less than) last 24 hours, it seems that the VMware image type got the most download, followed closely by the installable ISO format. I guess that was due to VirtualBox being able to use *.vmdk files and some people opting for the free virtualization tool.</description>

      <description>With the GNOME 2.30 release just around the corner, translators are feverishly working hard to get the desktop completely translated into a multitude of different languages! But unless you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable building the application you&amp;rsquo;re trying to translate on your own (or perhaps the entire desktop), you&amp;rsquo;re pretty much doing what I call &amp;ldquo;blind translations.&amp;rdquo;
 
From Screenshots The good news is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do any compiling to play with the very latest GNOME applications!</description>

      <description>Yesterday I attended my first TriZPUG meeting to check out Kurt Grandis&#39; talk on Fabric, &amp;ldquo;a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.&amp;rdquo;
It was pretty cool to see a bunch of guys who share the same interests take some time on a Thursday to hang out, drink beers, and chat about python, django, zope, and other stuff. After the original talk was over and some of the other lightening talks that succeeded it was over, a couple of things became very clear to me:</description>

      <description>In case you&amp;rsquo;ve missed it, the Xfce project has been using their own installation of Transifex to manage their translations online! Translators can now visit http://translations.xfce.org and keep up with the action!
 
From Transifex v8.0 featutes I&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing with translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language for quite some time now, and have been a strong supporter for the Transifex project as well, so I was thrilled to learn they were &amp;ldquo;working together&amp;rdquo;!</description>

      <description>In order to better follow what the Transifex guys are doing with their development and deployment of Transifex.net, I have finally made the switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL for the Transifex Appliance. Luckly I was able to corral diegobz during my lunch break and together we worked out the necessary changes to get things to work (and caught and fixed a minor issue along the way too!).
In the meantime, the appliance seems to be getting some nice and steady traffic, which I suspect will only increase, specially when a new version of Transifex hits the streets.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned on my Twitter account about our latest feat here at rPath, namely, &amp;ldquo;rPath Expands Operating System Coverage with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.&amp;rdquo; But the more I play with our technology, the more gaga I get at how simple we can make things!
So today I built a plain vanilla appliance based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5 withjust enough operating system and launched it on VMware vSphere 4.</description>

      <description>Had some time today during lunch to work on the Transifex Appliance and decided to play with the newly added feature of supporting subversion over https. So I launched thedevel EC2 instance on Amazon Web Service and proceeded to add PCMan File Manager so that I could translate it online. Before you ask, yes: I do have commit access to the project and could have checked out the code locally and done the work as I usually do, but that&amp;rsquo;s not fun!</description>

      <description>Just to follow up on one of my earlier messages to Twitter/Identi.ca today, here&amp;rsquo;s a little trivia for you:
 &amp;quot;What do Moblin, Xfce, Fedora plus a few other projects have in common? They all use Transifex for their translations!&amp;quot;
 There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few other projects out there already toying with Transifex to see if it fits their needs too, which goes to show that the word is getting out about the benefits of using it as a platform for managing translations.</description>

      <description>For those of you out there who are Foresight Linux users wondering when the next major software update will hit the stable branch, your wait is almost over! We&amp;rsquo;ve been feverishly making all the latest bits to play nice with each other so that we can also release newer ISO images of what will be Foresight 2.1.2. Some of the issues we&amp;rsquo;re facing right now are:
 Issues with latest *goocanvas/pycairo mess [0][1][2]; Epiphany issues with latest WebKit in x86_64; Exotic side effects of kernel changes that make audio CDs not easilly playable (not a Foresight exclusive issue); Mono is somehow partly busted (part of gnome bindings) in x86_64  hits latest banshee;   Getting Anaconda to play nicely with newer kernel drivers for some motherboards;  Some of the cool things we&amp;rsquo;re cooking in the development branch are: latest KDE, GNOME, Chromium/Firefox/Opera web browser, gst streamer bits, latest kernel, Banshee 1.</description>

      <description>Some time around the middle of 2008 I was asked if I would be interested in joining the very young QA department for rPath. I had already been working as a software engineer for them since late 2006, spending a larger chunk of my time working on a single project and not being able to experiment with the cool technology we were developing outside of my project. Somehow the idea of doing QA felt very appealing to me as I would then be able to see, first hand, what type of products we were publishing, as well as experience what our customers and users were going through.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote anything on my blog so here are some interesting nuggets:
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been house hunting for the last 3-4 months and I can honestly say that it is a very intense experience! There are so many things to learn and remember and so many different things to consider! Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be nice if you knew right up front all the costs and fees involved in purchasing a house, the same way you know how much it costs to purchase a pair of sneakers (cost of sneakers plus sales tax)?</description>

      <description>Last weekend the Indifex developers released the new version of Transifex, &amp;ldquo;anÂ open service allowing people toÂ collaboratively translate software, documentation and other types of projects.&amp;rdquo; Codenamed &amp;ldquo;Pyro&amp;quot; (all releases are named after a X-Men villains), Transifex 0.7 has a pretty lengthy list of new features and bug fixes to make any translator worth his/her salt cry with joy!
The one feature sure to turn people&amp;rsquo;s head is the ability to do their translations online using their Lotte Translation Editor.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to re-enforce what Zhang said earlier today about the bleeding edge GNOME Developer&amp;rsquo;s Kit, now with extra sauce!
What is it? It is a continuous build of GNOME packages all bundled up into a distribution (in this case, Foresight Linux) and distributed in a few different formats, such as ISO and VMware.

&amp;quot;What&amp;rsquo;s so special about it&amp;quot;, you ask? Is it the fact that different image types can be generated at will?</description>

Manage to spend some time today to check what&amp;rsquo;s new with the Transifex project and am very impressed with the direction it is going.

What you see above is the new tool/feature being added for inline, online translation of projects, codenamed Lotte!</description>

      <description>Does your role within a project have you asking the following questions?
 How do I provide an interface for translators to submit translations to multiple projects, regardless of the type of the underlying VCS? How do I reduce the overhead a project maintainer usually undertakes to administrate accounts for translators? How do I help translators do more by eliminating the need to subscribe to each VCS and learn its commands and tricks?</description>

Mesmo sendo um usuário do GNU/Linux por tanto tempo, foi somente 2 anos atrás que comecei a usá-lo o tempo todo. Como eu antes trabalhava como um desenvolvedor de .NET e Oracle durante o dia para o Departamento de Educação da cidade de New York, eu tinha um ambiente padrão de desenvolvedor instalado em meu sistema e nada mais.</description>

      <description>No finalzinho do ano passado eu passei alguns dias trabalhando para configurar um servidor de músicas bem simples para usar em casa. Como eu estou sempre fazendo algo maluco no meu desktop/laptop que eventualmente sempre me leva a re-instalar o meu sistema operacional, eu estou constantemente movendo meus arquivos de música entre computadores e discos externos. Quando você tem uma coleção de tamanho considerado, este exercício se torna um pé no saco.</description>

      <description>For the past few days I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on setting up a minimalistic music server for home. As I am always doing some crazy things to my desktop/laptop that eventually leads me to re-install my operating system, I find myself constantly moving music files between computers and external media. When you have a decent sized music library, this excercise starts to become a major pain. That&amp;rsquo;s how I came up with the idea of creating a media server using mt-daapd as my tool of choice.</description>

      <description>Built a MT-Daapd Linux appliance to share my music at home. Installed it in a machine with 1GB of RAM and am now as happy as I can be. The whole thing weighs in at 237MB (I&amp;rsquo;ve included vim, openssh, libogg plus a few other nuggets) and off course everything is managed by the awesome conary technology. I&amp;rsquo;ve also added ushare (upnp support) and am hoping to make it so that sharing videos and music can be all done via a web interface.</description>

Note que você vai ter de fazer uma modificação no obconf substituindo &amp;lsquo;obrender-3.0&amp;rsquo; e &amp;lsquo;obparser-3.0&amp;rsquo; por &amp;lsquo;obrender-4.0&amp;rsquo; e &amp;lsquo;obparser-4.0&amp;rsquo; respectivamente no arquivo configure.ac.
Ou se você usar uma distribuição baseada no systema conary, existe uma versão empacotada diretamente do repositório git que você pode instalar executando o comando sudo conary update openbox=foresightlinux.rpath.org@fl:2-devel.</description>

      <description>if you like Openbox and want to play with the upcoming 3.4.8 version, download the release candidate 1 here: http://icculus.org/openbox/releases/openbox-3.4.8-rc1.tar.gz. Keep in mind that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to patch obconf by basically replacing &amp;lsquo;obrender-3.0&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;obparser-3.0&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;obrender-4.0&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;obparser-4.0&amp;rsquo; respectively in the configure.ac file.
Or you use a conary-based system, there is a version packaged directly from their git repository which you can install by running sudo conary update openbox=foresightlinux.rpath.org@fl:2-devel.</description>

      <description>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ll be attending BarCamp Raleigh for the second year in a row. Together with a couple of fellow rPathians, I&amp;rsquo;m planning to pitch in the following talks:
 Building GNU/Linux appliances and deploying them in the clouds How to participate and contribute with open source projects like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Openbox, etc  If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the lucky ones who managed to register in time for the event, tomorrow there will be a get together (think drinks, snacks and all the trilug geeks you can fit in a bar) at Tyler&amp;rsquo;s Tap Room (map).</description>

      <description>As some of you may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a great deal of testing for rBuilder Online, rPath&amp;rsquo;s online community service for all your GNU/Linux appliances needs. As a QA Enginner I have a chance to play with the most innovative technologies we create (and dare I say some of the coolest things in the system/package management world?) before it hits the general public.
It is because of this work and my recent super involvement with our products that I decided to create a videocast on how to create a virtual GNU/Linux appliance using rBuilder Online.</description>

There will be continuous builds (the plan is to have them daily) so that you&amp;rsquo;ll always have the freshest GNOME code to play with. For the translators out there, I&amp;rsquo;ve recommended the inclusion of poEdit, intltool, translate-toolkit and gettext, all latest versions available.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post, I decided to give KDE a chance on my home system. For the last 5 days I&amp;rsquo;ve been neck deep in KDE land, with some fairly minor trips to non-KDE applications when I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to get something done (more on the soon).
The first step was to download the brand spanking alpha ISO for Foresight Linux KDE Edition (x86 here and x86_64 here) and bring it home.</description>

      <description>That is what the new version of Foresight Linux will offer with its new forthcoming version 2! I heard the news from Ken (Foresight&amp;rsquo;s leader and co-worker) last night and it has been confirmed by Elliot, our Anaconda tamer. Obviously your installation time may vary depending on your system, but I&amp;rsquo;m fairly sure they&amp;rsquo;ve used a standard PC for this. Another worthy mention is the addition of PackageKit as the graphical interface for our Conary package management system and we will definitely make a big splash with the addition of the Splashy boot splash!</description>

Eu escutei a noticia do Ken (lider do Foresight e meu companheiro de trabalho) ontem a noite e confirmado mais tarde pelo Elliot, nosso domador do Anaconda. Obviamente seu tempo de instalaÃ§Ã£o vai variar dependendo do seu sistema, mas estou bem seguro que eles usaram um sistema padrÃ£o nestes testes. Outra novidade importante Ã© a adiÃ§Ã£o do gerente de iniciaÃ§Ã£o Splashy e o PackageKit, nossa interface grÃ¡fica para o sistema de gerenciamento de pacotes Conary.</description>

      <description>Quick post to mention a couple of personal milestones and events:
 Today is my 1-year anniversary at rPath. It also marks 1 year since I stopped doing work with VB.NET/C# and PL/SQL and embarked in a brand new world of Python, and web-by programming&amp;hellip; There is not a day that I don&amp;rsquo;t learn something new! Sept. 29th marked 1 year since I left New Jersey for North Carolina! Besides the advantages of working with such a smart bunch (see above), I now get to spend quality time with my wife and two daughters.</description>

      <description>Tonight during our TriLUG meeting, Ken packaged Vinagre for the first time using Conary, the distributed software management system for Linux distributions. It took him literally no more than 5 minutes to write up the recipe, cook (package) it, and send it to the repository.

Vinagre is a VNC client well integrated with GNOME , current being developed by Jonh Wendell. For those curious as to what the recipe for packaging it was, take a look:</description>

Como somos os pioneiros desta Ã¡rea de Linux appliances, fiquei surpreso que nÃ£o houve muita informaÃ§Ã£o fornecida sobre o que nÃ³s (rPath) fazemos, nem mesmo um link para o web site da compania.</description>

      <description>It was interesting to see an article mentioning Canonical and rPath (where I work) in the same paragraph, since Ubuntu was responsible for my entrance into the open source world, and rPath is responsible for allowing me to work (i.e. get paid) with it!
Being the pioneers of the whole Linux appliances business, I was surprised that not much information was provided on what we (rPath) do, not even a link to the company&amp;rsquo;s web site.</description>

      <description>I was pleasantly surprised to see (as far as I know) the very first article written about APTonCD on last month&amp;rsquo;s issue (issue 95) of Linux Format, my favorite Linux magazine!

Back in August (or was it September?) of last year I learned that Rafael &amp;ldquo;CypherBIOS&amp;rdquo; ProenÃƒÂ§a had started this project written in Python that promised to deliver &amp;ldquo;a tool with a graphical interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs (you choose the type of media) with all of the packages you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded via APT-GET or APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that you can use on other computers.</description>

Anyhow, hope to be able to blog some more later today.

I really started using Vim full-time when I started working at rPath last October. Every now and then I learn a new trick and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d share them here, as well as make sure I can always search for them later (talk about killing 2 birds with a stone!).
The first one if is for those times you want to make a generic search and replace action on a file you&amp;rsquo;re working on.</description>

      <description>That is, Missing In Action / Prisoner Of WORK! Here at rPath we work based on iteration periods that could vary between 4 - 6 weeks. During these periods, we are all assigned (or loaded as we say) several hours of issues to work on plus whatever may come up during the course of the iteration. Decided to tackle all my issues without any disturbance, I took the plunge and have completely immersed myself in lots of python, javascript, and you name it!</description>

      <description>Had a really nice surprise waiting for me today at work in the form of an envelope covered with Brazilian postal stamps.

It was a gift from my friend Vladimir Melo, who saw an article written about the package management system Conary, product from the company I work for. There was also another article talking about the GNOME 2.18 release and the fact that it was completely translated to the Brazilian Portuguese language, thanks to the collaborative work of 16 people.</description>

      <title>Empacotando software com Conary</title>

      <description>Muitas pessoas jÃ¡ tinham me pedido para escrever um pequeno tutorial sobre como empacotar software para o Foresight Linux. Para quem ainda nÃ£o conhece o sistema de gerenciamento de pacotes Conary, uma forma de descrevÃª-lo seria comparÃ¡-lo com um sistema de controle de versÃµes e gerenciamento de pacotes. Isso quer dizer que vocÃª tem um controle sobre as modificaÃ§Ãµes do cÃ³digo no mesmo estilo do CVS ou SVN, e qualquer modificaÃ§Ã£o feita pelo mantenedor do cÃ³digo original Ã© implementado em seu pacote em fragmentos, equivalentes Ã s linhas que foram adicionadas ou modificadas.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote about my pet project, BillReminder, a late and due bills notifier for the desktop. With the birth of my daughter Kate, and the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved with at rPath, together with the translation of GNOME 2.18, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much time left to do anything else. Fortunately, I had the great pleasure of adding one more developer to the project: Luiz Armesto.</description>

      <description>JÃ¡ faz um bom tempo que nÃ£o escrevo nada sobre o meu programa para notificaÃ§Ã£o de contas, o BillReminder. Com o nascimento da minha filha Kate, e os novos projetos que apareceram no meu trabalho na rPath, e as traduÃ§Ãµes do GNOME 2.18, nÃ£o tinha sobrado muito tempo para fazer mais nada. Felizmente, tive a prazerosa inclusÃ£o de mais um desenvolvidor no BillReminder: Luiz Armesto.
Depois de trocar umas idÃ©ias pelo IRC sobre o rumo que eu queria levar o projeto, o Luiz simplesmente carregou em suas costas a grande responsabilidade de re-escrever o sistema de banco de dados, para suportar uma arquitetura mais flexivel e dinÃ¢mica.</description>

These images will be generated periodically so that you&amp;rsquo;ll always have the latest, bleeding edge GNOME to play with! So if you&amp;rsquo;re involved with documentation, translation, or development for the GNOME Project, and don&amp;rsquo;t feel like building it yourself, this is the best form to test your work before it gets released.

      <description>Saiu hoje pela manhÃ£ a tÃ£o esperada versÃ£o Live CD do GNOME, contendo a versÃ£o 2.17.92 do ambiente de trabalho do GNOME.
Baseado no Foresight Linux, este CD impressiona bastante por conter todos os pacotes do GNOME + alguns programas adicionais, localizaÃ§Ã£o completa (ou seja, suporte para todos os idiomas que foram traduzidos, incluindo o portuguÃªs do Brasil), e tudo isso em uma imagem ISO de somente 490 MB!
O plano Ã© continuar gerando estes Live CDs, culminando com o lanÃ§amento da versÃ£o 2.</description>

      <description>After a very brief night of sleep (about 3 hours), Elizabeth started having contractions, strong enough for us to drive to the hospital. At around 5:18 EST our second daughter Kate Maciel was born!

There were some post-partum complications and Elizabeth lost a lot of blood, but the doctors seem to have things under control now.
Nothing can prepare you for the roller coaster of emotions one goes through when witnessing the birth of your child.</description>

      <description>Bem, depois de quase 2 semanas doente com um resfriado horrÃ­vel, eu melhorei em tempo para o ano novo! Este ano (passado) de 2006 provou ter sido um ano super movimentado para a minha familia e eu. Creio que eu viajei e conheci mais pessoas e lugares em 2006 do que nos Ãºltimos 5 anos combinados! JÃ¡ que vÃ¡rias pessoas escreveram sobre o que aconteceu no ano de 2006, eis a minha tentativa fotogrÃ¡fica.</description>
