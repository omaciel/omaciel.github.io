                <div class="d-block text-truncate">With the GNOME 2.30 release just around the corner, translators are feverishly working hard to get the desktop completely translated into a multitude of different languages! But unless you&rsquo;re comfortable building the application you&rsquo;re trying to translate on your own (or perhaps the entire desktop), you&rsquo;re pretty much doing what I call &ldquo;blind translations.&rdquo;
 
From Screenshots The good news is that you don&rsquo;t have to do any compiling to play with the very latest GNOME applications!</div>

It was pretty cool to see a bunch of guys who share the same interests take some time on a Thursday to hang out, drink beers, and chat about python, django, zope, and other stuff. After the original talk was over and some of the other lightening talks that succeeded it was over, a couple of things became very clear to me:</div>

From Transifex v8.0 featutes I&rsquo;ve been contributing with translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language for quite some time now, and have been a strong supporter for the Transifex project as well, so I was thrilled to learn they were &ldquo;working together&rdquo;!</div>

Luckly I was able to corral diegobz during my lunch break and together we worked out the necessary changes to get things to work (and caught and fixed a minor issue along the way too!).
In the meantime, the appliance seems to be getting some nice and steady traffic, which I suspect will only increase, specially when a new version of Transifex hits the streets.</div>

So today I built a plain vanilla appliance based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5 withjust enough operating system and launched it on VMware vSphere 4.</div>

 &quot;What do Moblin, Xfce, Fedora plus a few other projects have in common? They all use Transifex for their translations!&quot;
 There&rsquo;s quite a few other projects out there already toying with Transifex to see if it fits their needs too, which goes to show that the word is getting out about the benefits of using it as a platform for managing translations.</div>

We&rsquo;ve been feverishly making all the latest bits to play nice with each other so that we can also release newer ISO images of what will be Foresight 2.1.2. Some of the issues we&rsquo;re facing right now are:
 Issues with latest *goocanvas/pycairo mess [0][1][2]; Epiphany issues with latest WebKit in x86_64; Exotic side effects of kernel changes that make audio CDs not easilly playable (not a Foresight exclusive issue); Mono is somehow partly busted (part of gnome bindings) in x86_64  hits latest banshee;   Getting Anaconda to play nicely with newer kernel drivers for some motherboards;  Some of the cool things we&rsquo;re cooking in the development branch are: latest KDE, GNOME, Chromium/Firefox/Opera web browser, gst streamer bits, latest kernel, Banshee 1.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Some time around the middle of 2008 I was asked if I would be interested in joining the very young QA department for rPath. I had already been working as a software engineer for them since late 2006, spending a larger chunk of my time working on a single project and not being able to experiment with the cool technology we were developing outside of my project. Somehow the idea of doing QA felt very appealing to me as I would then be able to see, first hand, what type of products we were publishing, as well as experience what our customers and users were going through.</div>

 I&rsquo;ve been house hunting for the last 3-4 months and I can honestly say that it is a very intense experience! There are so many things to learn and remember and so many different things to consider! Wouldn&rsquo;t be nice if you knew right up front all the costs and fees involved in purchasing a house, the same way you know how much it costs to purchase a pair of sneakers (cost of sneakers plus sales tax)?</div>
