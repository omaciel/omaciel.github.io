 Last night our Transifex installation turned 1 year old. I think with 101 users and 4012 submissions in 45 languages it has been quite a step forward compared to the previous mailing list-based submission system. For that I'd like to thank all the people involved, most noticeably Jannis for the initial setup, the Transifex guys for help and fixing bugs, Og for the appliance we've been running for the last half year and of course the Translators with all their patience and effort to make it a success.</div>
