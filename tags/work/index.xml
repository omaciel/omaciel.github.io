      <description>The last time I wrote about Quality Engineering, I mentioned that some of the reasons why people are not familiar with this term are, in no particular order:
 &#39;Quality&#39; is usually something that is added as an after thought and doesn&#39;t really come into the picture, if ever, until the very end of the release process Nobody outside of a QA team really knows what they do. It has something to do with testing.</description>

      <description>Whenever I meet someone for the first time, after we get past the initial niceties typically involved when you meet someone for the first time, eventually the conversation shifts to work and what one does for a living. Inevitably I&#39;m faced with what, at a first glance, may sound like a simple question and the conversation goes like this:
 New acquaintance: &amp;quot;What do you do at Red Hat?&amp;quot; Me: &amp;quot;I manage a team of quality engineers for a couple of different products.</description>

      <title>Three Years and Counting!</title>

      <description>Making a quick pit stop to mark this milestone in my professional career: today is my 3-year anniversary at Red Hat! Time has certainly flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since I joined this company.
I know it is sort of cliche to say &amp;quot;I can not believe that it has been this long...&amp;quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true.</description>

      <description>Kinda scary when you can relate your job to a movie:
 BOB SLYDELL Y&amp;rsquo;see, what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do here, we&amp;rsquo;re just trying to get a feel for how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk us through a typical day for you? PETER Yeah. BOB SLYDELL Great. PETER Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side door, that way Lumbergh can&amp;rsquo;t see me.</description>

      <description>Today all consultants working for my current employer received the email below (contents changed to protect the innocents):
 As the old-timers among you know, I periodically ask the IT consultants the gross annual or hourly pay you receive from your respective consultant firm. This information helps us determine the salary range and level of equity among the consultants of each work type/skill set; check that the consultant firm margins are somewhat reasonable, etc.</description>

      <title>What Does It Mean???</title>

      <description>What does it mean when your direct supervisor keeps asking you to do some of his tasks and you know for a fact there&amp;rsquo;s no promotion involved? I guess my biggest &amp;ldquo;beef&amp;rdquo; is the type of stuff he asks me to write about:
 What is .NET and what advantages does it offer? What are the advantages of using Microsoft Visual Source Safe (VSS)? What are the requirements for working on the code library we just purchased and have no documentation on?</description>

      <description>While typing my last post I was interrupted by a so-called &amp;ldquo;.Net Developer who just earned his PMP.&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;ldquo;featured&amp;rdquo; here before for asking &amp;ldquo;very intelligent questions.&amp;rdquo; =) This time he told me he had just bundled some application and given to a DBA to run it when they received an error message: Oracle[blah blah blah].dll not found!!!
 &amp;quot;So this program you wrote is trying to connect to an Oracle database?</description>

      <description>Been really busy attending the Project Management class these last 3 days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very interesting but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of material and concepts to absorb. The end product of this is that I get home completely drained and just pass out! Been &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; off of a million cups of coffee and caffeinated snacks&amp;hellip; Still haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to play with Perforce and have 4 new books awaiting for me at home.</description>

      <description>Starting today I will be stuck attending some training class for work. These &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; start at 9am and end at 4:30pm, all through Friday! Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to grab a cup of coffee in the next 5 minutes. Managed to update this blog to WordPress 1.5.1. Since this was a bux-fixing release, don&amp;rsquo;t expect to find anything changed here.
As a side note, am looking forward to some WoW playing time with Vinny tonight!</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what I was getting into when I was told to attend &amp;ldquo;a class&amp;rdquo; at work starting today. To be honest, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very thrilled about the idea but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had a choice, I prepared myself to spend some long, boring hours at the &amp;ldquo;class room.&amp;rdquo; Well, it turns out that besides learning to use a project management tool called Primavera, we are also learning what it takes to professionaly managed a project (from the IT perspective).</description>

      <description>After battling for a few days with a certain free (as in non-proxy-ed) wifi AP, I experienced approximately 5 minutes of unlimited freedom right after lunch. My friend Kelvin and I had spent a good chunk of our morning trying to figure out why the connection was dropping all the time but to no avail. I did some &amp;ldquo;googling&amp;rdquo; around and saw that some people have been complaining about the same problem but for me this only happens at this certain AP.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I wonder how certain people get employed&amp;hellip; really! I usually get drilled with a bunch of technical questions in every job interview I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to (with the exception of a couple where the hiring manager had absolutely no clue about IT&amp;hellip; this re-enforces me original point!) and feel that I really have to show &amp;ldquo;what I&amp;rsquo;m made of.&amp;rdquo; In the meantime, some people get hired and surprisingly manage to keep their jobs whilst they lack (IMNSHO) the knowledge and skills.</description>

      <description>Wow!!! It is amazing how great this whole week has been for me so far at work! Been churning out code for my very simple data to xml application and sometimes (the horror) I don&amp;rsquo;t even want to go home so I won&amp;rsquo;t interrupt the grooviness! Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled to give a live demo to the rest of the group! I&amp;rsquo;m ready to blow them off their socks! For such a simple and small program, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done a pretty good job at making it usefull and stable!</description>

      <description>Yesterday our recently elected CIO paid us a little visit for the first time. The entire IT team attended the hour long meeting where the CIO very eloquently explained his plan for the entire IT organization (which is actually made up of several smaller IT groups throughout the Board of Education). In the end he &amp;ldquo;opened up the floor&amp;rdquo; for questions and/or comments. For a grueling 10 seconds nobody uttered a word.</description>

      <description>Today I actually enjoyed work!!! Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to mention &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enjoy&amp;rdquo; together? I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it since early 2002 when I worked for the now defunct Synaptic Pharmaceuticals!!! I spent most of the day working on a new VB.NET application for work (something very small and simple for XML generation) and my C# (soon to become Mono) rss reader. It feels absolutely great to be back in the groove of coding!</description>

      <description>What a week this has been&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s only Monday!!! After putting up with a lot of infantile abuse from my upper management things seem to be heading South. I used to feel that the entire organization was plotting against me and wondered if it was just me. But now, I have definite confirmation that my sanity is still somewhat intact! My new co-worker (and I think she was also hired to be my supervisor) has been experiencing all the abuse herself for a few weeks now and seems to be in the brink of walking out of here!</description>

      <description>My daughter&amp;rsquo;s daycare was closed today due to the weather. Eventhough there&amp;rsquo;s less than 2 inches of snow on the ground they decided that it was safer not to open today. I think they just used a very lame excuse to have a day off and since they get paid no matter what, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt them in the pocket.
So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day back to work since last Wednesday when I flew to Boston to attend Linux World Expo. It started out just like any other day: woke up early, drove daughter to daycare, crawled through traffic on the FDR Drive, parked across the street and coughed up the $11 daily rate, signed in at 8:25am, walked into my cubicle, said hello to my co-worker&amp;hellip; Only there was no reply&amp;hellip; there was nobody sitting there&amp;hellip; in fact, the space previously taken by my Russian friend was empty!</description>

      <description>No word about getting a copy of my database backup yet&amp;hellip; In the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s a (mug) shot of my at my so called &amp;ldquo;prison cell.&amp;rdquo; Been here for almost 6 months and haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten used to living in this &amp;ldquo;cubicle forest&amp;rdquo; yet. The inhabitants are a bit edgy and can turn to cannibals without any warning. Boy, am I glad that Tux is here to protect me (that&amp;rsquo;s him sitting atop my pc).</description>
