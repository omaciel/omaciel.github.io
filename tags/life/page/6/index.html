It sort of reminds me of what I think Open Source and Community really means! I have personally gotten insulted in the past by some pretty lame IRC users who assume that everyone is an idiot and who can&rsquo;t say anything helpfull but repeat &ldquo;rtfm&rdquo; to every enquire. But I will not go off on a tangent here and rant about all those &ldquo;newbie basher&rdquo; loosers out there.</div>

It is the 7th meeting I have organized ever since taken over the group back in September 2004. I managed to get there earlier than usual and took advantage of the extra time to write down some ideas I had for a new pet project of mine and get some good coffee. One hour later some of the frequent attendees arrived.</div>

He even performed an on-site strep throat test to see if that was the problem but the results were inconclusive.</div>

I was up and early for my appointments at the Department of Computer Science considering I went to sleep really late the previous night. It was my sister&rsquo;s birthday so I took her out to the movies and a late dinner.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Arrived here in North Carolina last night at the Raleigh-Durham airport. My younger sister was waiting for me and as soon as we picked up my luggage we headed to her apartment in Chapel Hill. Woke up early today and went to my first (and only) meeting with the chair of the School of Information and Library Science at UNC. My sister had set up the meeting for me and I must admit I wasn&rsquo;t too sure if I wanted to spend the time to talk to someone from a department that had the word &ldquo;library&rdquo; in it.</div>

I&rsquo;ll be staying at my younger sister&rsquo;s apartment which I believe is near the UNC's Chapel Hill campus. She's already scheduled 4 interviews with the chairs of 4 different departments and I have just emailed her to try to get me 2 more.</div>
