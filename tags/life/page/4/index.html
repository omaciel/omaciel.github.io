Armed with a hot cup of coffee I proceeded to get boot my laptop and get some internet going&hellip; About 15 minutes later I realized something fishy was going on with the free wifi for I just could not get a working IP assigned.</div>

My new co-worker (and I think she was also hired to be my supervisor) has been experiencing all the abuse herself for a few weeks now and seems to be in the brink of walking out of here!</div>
