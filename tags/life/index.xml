      <description>Growing up my dad used to tell me that there are three important milestones on a man’s life (though I feel that the same could be said about any gender):
 Plant a tree Have a child Write a book  Through my life, I have planted quite a few trees, including a lemon and papaya tree I used to treat as my imaginary friends :)
I have also had the highest honor to be the father to three amazing girls!</description>

      <title>Software Quality Engineering: Tales From The Trenches</title>

      <description>First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love being a Quality Engineer, something that I have been doing for a living for the last 11 years of my life! During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</description>

      <description>It was June 8th,1974 and on a warm evening in the territory of Amapá, now a state in the northern part of Brazil, a baby boy was born. Other than being a couple of months premature, the one thing that made this birth a bit more interesting than any premature birth was the fact that this baby had its hands and feet completely bent inwards, almost fused into his arms and legs.</description>

      <description>Woke up this morning and, as usual, sat down to read the Books section of The New York Times while drinking my coffee. This has become sort of a &#39;tradition&#39; for me and because of it I have been able to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have found out on my own. I also &#39;blame&#39; this activity to turning my nightstand into a mini-library on its own.</description>

      <title>The End For Pylyglot</title>

      <description>Background It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even during working hours, that eventually I sort of &amp;quot;made a name for myself&amp;quot; and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</description>

      <description>My parents were eagerly awaiting our arrival on an early Spring morning, and when our plane finally landed after the almost 10 1/2 hours flight and we made our way to the luggage claim area, the reunion was filled with a lot of hugging, laughter and a huge sigh of relief. For someone who had spent most of their entire lives in a small and sleepy town in the East coast of Brazil, waking up and finding yourself at JFK Airport was nothing short of a major event!</description>

      <title>Running On Empty</title>

      <description>This post has been sitting in my Drafts folder for a while now, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure when the right time would be to publish it. It is basically my personal reflection on the last 5 years I have worked doing translations for free and open source software (FOSS) and a few lessons I learned along the way. It is also a rant against those who took my labor for granted.</description>
