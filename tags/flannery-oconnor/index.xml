This August 2015 I took a break from work and spent about 6 days enjoying some R&amp;amp;R down the North Carolina shore with my family. I managed to get through some of the books that were waiting for a long time for me to get to them, as well as try some new authors.
Read   The Sentinel by Arthur C. Clarke
I forgot where I read about how the short story &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; was the inspiration for &amp;quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;quot;, but being that I have always considered the latter a great book and movie, I managed to grab a copy of the anthology &amp;quot;The Sentinel&amp;quot; just so that I could read the short story by the same name and see what else Arthur C.</description>

Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about Linux, get an education, a job and, let&#39;s be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I &#39;forced&#39; myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading for fun every day.</description>
