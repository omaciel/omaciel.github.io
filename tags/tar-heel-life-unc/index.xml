      <description>Once again I avoided mentioning about a very serious job lead I had with the University of North Carolina at the Chappel Hill campus, afraid of jinxing myself. Well, today I have finally recieved the final verdict after the 3-weeks long process: they decided to go with a local candidate who had a slight advantage over me (apparently some accounting and project management experience) and had just lost her job. I confess I&amp;rsquo;m a bit disappointed at the moment for it is the fourth position in a row I was genuinely interested that I see slip through my fingers&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to put a positive spin on this and make myself believe that the best is yet to come&amp;hellip; Kind of hard to do when you think of the previous chances (Microsoft for instance)&amp;hellip; =/</description>

      <description>Arrived here in North Carolina last night at the Raleigh-Durham airport. My younger sister was waiting for me and as soon as we picked up my luggage we headed to her apartment in Chapel Hill. Woke up early today and went to my first (and only) meeting with the chair of the School of Information and Library Science at UNC. My sister had set up the meeting for me and I must admit I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure if I wanted to spend the time to talk to someone from a department that had the word &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; in it.</description>

      <description>This Wednesday I embark on what may be the most important trip of my life: I&amp;rsquo;ll be visiting and interviewing with the chairs of several different departments at the North Carolina Univertsity with the objective of gathering information for my possible come back to the academic world. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 8 years since I graduated from Pace University and my plans of earning a PhD/MD diploma have taken a major detour.</description>
