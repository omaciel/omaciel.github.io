Managed to update this blog to WordPress 1.5.1. Since this was a bux-fixing release, don&rsquo;t expect to find anything changed here.
As a side note, am looking forward to some WoW playing time with Vinny tonight!</div>

Tomorrow I&rsquo;m scheduled to give a live demo to the rest of the group! I&rsquo;m ready to blow them off their socks!
