      <description>The NY Times&#39; restriction of 10 articles/month for non-subscribers, online viewers means I won&#39;t be reading their Books section anymore. It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look forward to on Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace and quietness as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the latest books and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip down to the public library with the whole family.</description>
