      <description>Growing up my dad used to tell me that there are three important milestones on a manâ€™s life (though I feel that the same could be said about any gender):
 Plant a tree Have a child Write a book  Through my life, I have planted quite a few trees, including a lemon and papaya tree I used to treat as my imaginary friends :)
I have also had the highest honor to be the father to three amazing girls!</description>

      <description>First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love being a Quality Engineer, something that I have been doing for a living for the last 11 years of my life! During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</description>
