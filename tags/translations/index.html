                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Background It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even during working hours, that eventually I sort of &quot;made a name for myself&quot; and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote about Pylyglot, my translation searching tool that I use whenever I translate open source applications. Have not heard about Pylyglot? Read the About page for more info!
The reasons for the long hiatus are too many to enumerate, but suffice to say that the project is very much alive and I intend to keep updating the translations database as often as possible.
So, what&rsquo;s new?</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Hey, are you feverishly working on the translation for the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release? Do you find yourself often wondering how a certain word was translated across the entire desktop applications? Well, I do and this is why I developed Pylyglot, a Django-driven localization tool that let&rsquo;s you search for a word and see how it has been translated for a given language. The plan is to have fresh data straight from the GNOME git repositories every Monday for now, eventually switching to a more frequent update schedule.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Thanks to comments by booxter and Patrick Niedzielski, I have added support for 2 more languages to Pylyglot: Belarusian and Esperanto! So far I had been adding languages according to their translation percentage, starting from the top and slowly moving down the list, but it probably makes sense to add some of the languages that need a bit of help catching up with the other teams and provide them with a means to check their standardization.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">What a difference a day makes! Thanks to some feedback I got both here and in private, and thanks to a contributor with some extra free cycles at hand, Pylyglot got anotherÂ face liftÂ today.
So what&rsquo;s new? There are now 245 total packages and 3,165,335 translations from yesterday&rsquo;s 61 packages and 954,884 translations! You can also now link to a query using the resulting url from your searches using the format language=FOO&amp;query=BAR, where FOO is the language&rsquo;s ISO code and BAR is the term you&rsquo;re searching.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Been working on a pet project to help out with theÂ GNOME translations (as well as have a chance to learn more about Django) and the end product is now available at www.pylyglot.org. Basically, it is a database of all strings from all available GNOME packages parsed to (hopefully) help open source translators with their effort by providing suggestions based on existing translations.
But wait, there&rsquo;s more! Since the entire collection of GNOME packages is available for your perusal, you can check how a certain word was translated across all packages and use this information to standardize the translation for the entire project.</div>

 Last night our Transifex installation turned 1 year old. I think with 101 users and 4012 submissions in 45 languages it has been quite a step forward compared to the previous mailing list-based submission system. For that I'd like to thank all the people involved, most noticeably Jannis for the initial setup, the Transifex guys for help and fixing bugs, Og for the appliance we've been running for the last half year and of course the Translators with all their patience and effort to make it a success.</div>
