      <description>Background It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even during working hours, that eventually I sort of &amp;quot;made a name for myself&amp;quot; and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</description>

      <title>Pylyglot: Open Source Translation Search</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote about Pylyglot, my translation searching tool that I use whenever I translate open source applications. Have not heard about Pylyglot? Read theÂ About page for more info!
The reasons for the long hiatus are too many to enumerate, but suffice to say that the project is very much alive and I intend to keep updating the translations database as often as possible.
So, what&amp;rsquo;s new?</description>
