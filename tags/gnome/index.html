Ever since I started doing Python development using Emacs, I have unsuccessfully tried to configure Rope, &ldquo;a python refactoring library&rdquo;&hellip; until last Friday.

In the past, my contributions were mostly related to translating applications to Brazilian Portuguese, but my role on that front was very minimal this time and consisted of a handful of translations and several commits of the awesome work done by others. Most of my contributions for 3.0 are related to the work I do for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors, but I won&rsquo;t bore you to tears!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Hey, are you feverishly working on the translation for the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release? Do you find yourself often wondering how a certain word was translated across the entire desktop applications? Well, I do and this is why I developed Pylyglot, a Django-driven localization tool that let&rsquo;s you search for a word and see how it has been translated for a given language. The plan is to have fresh data straight from the GNOME git repositories every Monday for now, eventually switching to a more frequent update schedule.</div>

The second day was very busy and full of things to do and interesting discussions.</div>
