      <description>I completely missed this little nugget:
 &amp;quot;Cuba will gradually switch to the open-source Linux operating system for its state computers, eliminating its exclusive use of Microsoft Windows, the government daily Juventud Rebelde reported&amp;quot;
 If they succeed with this migration Cuba will become (I believe) the first nation to completely go Open Source! Maybe Brazil will be next???</description>

      <description>My previous post talked about how our lives are getting registered in the internet, free for everyone and anyone to see. Today I learned about this site which has only strengthened my &amp;ldquo;thesis.&amp;rdquo;
 &amp;quot;is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard.&amp;quot;
 Some of these so called postcards are the scariest things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen online in quite some time&amp;hellip; Rather disturbing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Having read this yesterday on how Google has become such a major presence in our life style, today&amp;rsquo;s article in the NY Times showed me yet another facet to living in the 21st century. I can only imagine future archeologists performing &amp;ldquo;cyber-digs&amp;rdquo; in order to study civilizations from our time. Why travel to Egypt if you can uncover everything there is to know about the pyramids from the confort of your house using Google search and maps?</description>

      <description>I needed to do some image editing the other day and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like installing anything &amp;ldquo;big and complicated&amp;rdquo; like Photoshop or PSP. Google&amp;rsquo;s Picasa software came to mind and I quickly downloaded it on my laptop. I misy tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed with user interface. Not as much with the features (which by the way are just enough for your daily crop-resize-remove red eye needs) but the looks of it!</description>

Didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to taste it but if it is as good as some of the other Australian wines I&amp;rsquo;ve had and robust like Linux, then it should be great! =)

      <description>With the upcoming release of Whidbey (Visual Studio 2005) scheduled for some time this Summer, Microsoft has already been busy working on the next 2 versions: Orca and Hawaii. &amp;quot;Microsoft officials said that while Whidbey will help developers target the upcoming Longhorn operating system, Orcas will be the version of the tool set that will enable developers to ride what the company calls the Longhorn wave and tap the new features of the operating system.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you could do all of these with rss!!! Wow!!! Read the original post here.
 Get the news as it happens from multiple news sources  An RSS feed reader is an aggregator of numerous feeds from news sources (and nearly every major paper and TV news network has RSS feeds today). But now there are even feeds that aggregate other feeds. The new RSSmix.com lets you combine all the news source RSS feeds into one single feed so you get news as it happens.</description>

      <description>I just had to get this off my chest! I have read a few &amp;ldquo;reviews&amp;rdquo; for The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy and am very annoyed by what everyone is saying. I&amp;rsquo;d say that 5% of these so called reviews say that nobody should see it due to its deviations from the original book, how they Hollywood-ed the plot by adding a romance, yadda, yadda&amp;hellip; And I kept thinking: &amp;ldquo;So what the movie is not a transcription from book?</description>

      <description>Your brain: 60% interpersonal, 60% visual, 100% verbal, and 180% mathematical!
Congratulations on being 400% smart! Actually, on my test, everyone is. The above score breaks down what kind of thinking you most enjoy doing. A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing about how good you are at any one, just how interested you are in each, relatively.</description>

      <description>Read some posts of people talking about Audioscrobbler today and decided to see what the noise was all about.
 Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin for your media player (Winamp, iTunes, XMMS, foobar2000, etc..). Plugins send the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening statistics.</description>

      <description>Someone had commented on a previous post about a media player for Windows called Foobar2000. Having just been swept off my feet by Billy, I decided to give it a try. I chose the &amp;ldquo;Special&amp;rdquo; download option and was very impressed with the extensive options for music file formats available. There&amp;rsquo;s also a good amount of modules or plugins that can be downloaded from the web site. The interface is very simple and minimalistic, focusing almost that entirely on the task at hand: just playing your music files.</description>

      <description>I have finally found my portable MP3 and OGG player to use on the go with my Seagate 40GB disk (which I have nicknamed Pegasus): Billy! I downloaded the setup file and chose my Pegasus as the destination folder. I then chose one of the several music folders I have inside Pegasus and started listening to my songs immediately. The program seems to have been written for those of us who hate using the mouse and rather use keyboard shortcuts.</description>

      <description>Recently MeetUp, a then free group organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay $19 a month to use their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for the Northern NJ Linux Meetup I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean the end of the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far (with the exception of the day I brought someone from Ubuntu Linux to gives us a talk&amp;hellip; that day we had 7 members!</description>

      <description>Amazing upgrade to the already amazing Google Maps site. Don&amp;rsquo;t really know when it was implemented but you can now switch from the map view to a real satellite view, down to the street level!

      <description>I was really bad over this weekend&amp;hellip; I not only had a cup of (gasp!) Star Bucks coffee but I also managed to convince my wife that we deserved a new flat LCD monitor to replace our existing 17-inch. We finally settled (well, actually I settled for it&amp;hellip; she wasn&amp;rsquo;t too thrilled about it&amp;hellip; hehe) for a 20.1-inch Sony model. Its UXGA 1600 x 1200 resolution is amazing!!! I have so much space on my screen now&amp;hellip; I also managed to update the driver for my G-Force 5200 card adding the final touch to a great system.</description>

      <description>Ha! Planet Gnome and Planet KDE have played their April Fools trick on me today. Apparently they&amp;rsquo;ve switched their DNS entries (or whatever it is that is required) so that people visiting Planet Gnome will be directed to Planet KDE (but the URL still says planet.gnome.org) and vice-versa! I refreshed my page a couple of times untill I realized what had happened! Good one guys!
Update: Just noticed that Planet Debian has changed their Debian logo for an Ubuntu&#39;s.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really loving this &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; between Google and Yahoo, battling to see who attracts more users. I think we, the &amp;ldquo;middle man,&amp;rdquo; will only gain in the end. Today Google announced they&amp;rsquo;re increasing everyone&amp;rsquo;s gmail account to a whopping 2GB!!! Also, they&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to write emails using rich text features, such as: Bold, Italics, Underline, Select a special font, Font Size, Font Color, Background Color, Remove Formatting, Hyperlink Text, Numbered List, Bulleted List, Indent Less, Indent More, Quote Text, Left Align, Center Align, Right Align.</description>

      <description>I wanted to change some code I had written last week so that an ::google(&amp;ldquo;overloaded constructor&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;overloaded constructor&amp;rdquo;):: would call the default constructor. This is usefull when you have to perform an initialization to a class member no matter what constructor is called during the class&#39; initialization. I faintly remembered Java&amp;rsquo;s Base and SuperBase(?) syntax and tried several combinations of this and base keywords. Nothing seemed to work&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s when I came across this post which gave me the answer:</description>

      <description>Today I added the Dynamic Text Replace plugin for WordPress to my blog. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lazy when it comes to writing and hate when I cannot do something by using the keyboard only. Or when I have to type the same thing over and over. That is why I chose to use this plugin. Dynamic Text Replace &amp;ldquo;allows you to easily pre-define text replacement template strings and allow for text to be passed in.</description>

      <description>Interesting:
 A namber is part name and part number. Each number between 0 and 255 has a namber. For example, 1 is fun and 213 is star. A namber address is an internet address that uses nambers. For example, mysteryrobot.com&amp;rsquo;s namber is drum.start.orange.hope.mysteryrobot.com.
 Here&amp;rsquo;s what my site came out:
 www.ogmaciel.com is duck.bike.bank.dry.mysteryrobot.com Your address is bed.monkey.jump.best.mysteryrobot.com (12.145.122.16)

      <description>An interesting read (sorry&amp;hellip; free registration required) about Brazil&amp;rsquo;s involvement with the Open Source movement. It seems that Linux has joined Soccer as this country&amp;rsquo;s passion. The New York Times says &amp;ldquo;Brazil: Free Software&amp;rsquo;s Biggest and Best Friend&amp;rdquo;.
 Looking to save millions of dollars in royalties and licensing fees, Mr. da Silva has instructed government ministries and state-run companies to gradually switch from costly operating systems made by Microsoft and others to free operating systems, like Linux.</description>

      <description>Found a couple of pretty usefull and cool Gnome applets for my laptop over the weekend: netapplet and gnome-blog. Netapplet allows me to store multiple settings for different wifi access points for easy switching while on the road. Very usefull and easy to do! Gnome-blog is supposed to allow you to write a post to your blog without accessing the web interface. I say &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m yet to try it.</description>

I do browse a handfull of sites every day religiously but sometimes I crave for new material.

      <description>For all you crazy USB-Portable-Device-Lovers out there: Portable FireFox 1.0.2 has been released!!! My favorite new features are:
 COMMANDLINE PASSING - The Portable Firefox launcher now supports commandline passing! That&amp;rsquo;s right, you can drag an HTML file onto PortableFirefox.exe and drop it and it will open it right up. You can even manually set PortableFirefox.exe to be your default browser in Windows and it will open up URLs correctly. It will only pass in one commandline parameter and it is expecting it to be a URL.</description>

      <description>No, I did not get hired to work for Pixar. [sigh] I just wanted to point you to this interesting article describing the working environment there.
 A lot of the animators decided early on that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want cubicles, so instead, Pixar found these groovy little cottages that they bought for them. Walking through the animation department is like walking through a neighborhood for dwarves. Lots of little houses laid out along Ã¢â‚¬Å&amp;quot;streets,Ã¢â‚¬Â?</description>

I managed to upload all my 13 GB+ of MP3s and Oggs together with a bunch of usefull applications and code I was carrying with me on a couple of CDs for quite some time. Having a central and portable repository for all of my music, documents, and code is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted for the longest time. I have also started to use the portable version of Firefox, which contrary to the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; version runs off of a portable device and not a (non-portable) hard drive.</description>

 After reading about Musik Cube on two different places today I decided to give it a try. I downloaded it at work from one of the many mirrors and installed it in less than 1 minute. After the initial import process by which Musik Cube extracts and populates itself with the information from your media files, I was pleased with the simple and clean UI look.</description>

 After breaking (I&amp;rsquo;m still clueless as for what really happened&amp;hellip; Maybe I zapped it by wearing my fleece sweater) my SanDisk 1GB jump drive within 20 minutes of use last Wednesday, I finally drove back to CompUSA and picked up this little fella. It aboslutely rocks! I&amp;rsquo;ve now installed Portable Firefox 1.0.1 and really like it. Today I want to take the time to sort most of my MP3s and load them in for a fun, music-filled day at work.</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking through the old list of links and try to figure out which ones are the new ones, here they are:

      <description>Jakub Steiner from Planet Gnome mentioned an old article written by Joel Spolsky on the importance of writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time to absorb his &amp;ldquo;pearls of wisdom.&amp;rdquo; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure all your snacks are within reach so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to miss your favorite soap.</description>

      <description>My daughter&amp;rsquo;s daycare was closed today due to the weather. Eventhough there&amp;rsquo;s less than 2 inches of snow on the ground they decided that it was safer not to open today. I think they just used a very lame excuse to have a day off and since they get paid no matter what, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt them in the pocket.
So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.</description>

      <guid>https://omaciel.github.io/posts/top-10-reasons-for-wearing-a-kilt-/</guid>
      <description>Because through out history, men have worn un-bifurcated garments.
Because if women had an appendage hanging between their legs we guarantee you they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wearing pants.
Freedom, and increased mobility.
You only go around once, so why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you be as comfortable as possible.
All men deserve air conditioning in the summer. You will chafe no more.
No more adjust, right side, left side! Say goodbye to wedgies.
A word about the pockets: Unlike pants, the Utilikilt&amp;rsquo;s pockets are only sewn down on top, so that they move with the garment but not with your leg.</description>
