                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This past May 31st, I added the final touches to the first draft for what should become my third book and second Young Adult novel.
Temporarily titled The Big Score and currently, at approximately 44,000 words, you could say that this book was the hardest I&rsquo;ve written so far. While my previous book, &ldquo;I.C.Q.,&quot; took me around thirty contiguous days to complete the first draft, The Big Score started our back in November 1st as part of National Novel Writing Month 2020, and was only completed seven months later.</div>

From July 13th to the middle of August, I wrote fevereshly every day, working on what became &ldquo;I.C.Q.,&quot; my very first piece of fiction, which you can pre-order right now.

During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This week I started reading On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King, a book that has been mentioned a few times by people I usually interview for my weekly podcast as something that is both inspiring and has had a major impact on their lives and careers. After the third or forth time someone mentioned I finally broke down and got myself a copy at the local bookstore.</div>
