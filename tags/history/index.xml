 &amp;quot;Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&amp;quot; George Santayana
 Simon Wiesenthal, so called &amp;ldquo;the Nazi Hunter&amp;rdquo; passed away this morning during his sleep at age of 96. Having survived concentration camps during world war 2, he spent most of his post-war life investigating and helping bring Nazi war criminals to justice. Among the approximately 1,100 war criminals tracked down and captured thanks to his work were Adolf Eichmann and Franz Stangl, commandant at the Treblinka extermination camp.</description>
