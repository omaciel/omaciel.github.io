                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This week I started reading On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King, a book that has been mentioned a few times by people I usually interview for my weekly podcast as something that is both inspiring and has had a major impact on their lives and careers. After the third or forth time someone mentioned I finally broke down and got myself a copy at the local bookstore.</div>

Read 70 Books Grade: PASS
Even though I had a very, very busy year at work, with many releases of Red Hat Satellite 5 and Red Hat Satellite 6 shipped to our customers, I managed to surpass my goal of reading 70 books, finishing the year with a whopping 79 books read!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">For my last post of 2014 I wanted to show, with pictures, the books I read and spent so much time with this year.
Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my Reading Challenge. I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time, read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much younger.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Woke up this morning and, as usual, sat down to read the Books section of The New York Times while drinking my coffee. This has become sort of a 'tradition' for me and because of it I have been able to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have found out on my own. I also 'blame' this activity to turning my nightstand into a mini-library on its own.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">The NY Times' restriction of 10 articles/month for non-subscribers, online viewers means I won't be reading their Books section anymore. It sort of became a good habit for me and something I look forward to on Sunday mornings: as I drink my coffee and enjoy some peace and quietness as the kids are still asleep, I enjoy catching up with the latest books and reviews. This weekend ritual usually ends with a trip down to the public library with the whole family.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Depois de ter gravado mais de 9 episódios do Castálio Podcast (se você ainda não escutou, não sabe o que está acontecendo), e conversar sobre os acontecimentos, músicas, livros e filmes que moldaram a vida dos meus convidados, comecei a meditar sobre alguns dos livros que eu curtia ler quando garoto. Quando eu ainda morava no Brasil, nós tínhamos uma biblioteca bem variada na minha casa, com livro para tudo quanto é gosto&hellip; mas quando me mudei para os Estados Unidos em 1991 (para ler um pouco mais sobre esta história, leia a minha coluna na edição 25 da revista Espírito Livre) eu tive de deixar tudo para trás para trazer somente o que cabia na mala (até parece aquela música do Engenheiros do Hawaii).</div>
