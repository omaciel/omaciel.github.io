      <description>Today Firefox gave me a major scare when, instead of logging me to my website so I could write a post, it took me to http://meta.wikipedia.org!!! WTF??? I then fired up IE and tried it with success! I fugured something was up with Firefox but decided to do some more detective work. I successfully logged to my web host&amp;rsquo;s control panel and checked the internet stats for the last few days&amp;hellip; Boy, was I shocked when I saw this:</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you could do all of these with rss!!! Wow!!! Read the original post here.
 Get the news as it happens from multiple news sources  An RSS feed reader is an aggregator of numerous feeds from news sources (and nearly every major paper and TV news network has RSS feeds today). But now there are even feeds that aggregate other feeds. The new RSSmix.com lets you combine all the news source RSS feeds into one single feed so you get news as it happens.</description>

Tomorrow marks the 20th year that I have been living in the United States. Not to use an old cliché, but it definitely feels like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too long ago that I embarked on the greatest and most dramatic adventure of my life: at the young age of 16 (only a handful of weeks shy of my 17th birthday) I said goodbye to most of my friends back in the small town of Conceição da Barra, Brazil and got on a plane with my youngest sister bound to New York City.</description>

      <description>One of my New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution for 2010 was the ambitious goal of reading one book for every week of the year! In other words, to read a total of 52 books for 2010! I knew that it would be very hard to complete this resolution without cheating and choosing thin books but I figured: &amp;ldquo;Aim for the moon, that way, even if you miss you&amp;rsquo;ll still be amongst the stars!</description>

      <description>With the soon to be released GNOME version 2.24, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the new version for Cheese, a pretty slick application that &amp;ldquo;allows you to take photos, videos, and anything else you can think of with your webcam.&amp;rdquo; My kids and I have spent quite some time playing with the special effects, often combining a bunch of them to see who could come up with the silliest shot.
When Daniel asked me if he could use some of my shots to create a tour for the new release, it gave us one more reason to play with Cheese.</description>

      <description>I finally caved in and gave beryl a try. After being literally bombarded with screenshots and videos os people doing some pretty cool stuff on their computers, I figured: &amp;ldquo;I have a pretty good system here&amp;hellip; why not add some bling to it?&amp;rdquo;
I followed my friend Hamacker&#39;s recipe (in portuguese, but there&amp;rsquo;s a good tutorial here in english) and was running beryl in no time! I must have spent at least 1 hour just tweaking all the possible configurations allowed!</description>

      <description>My good friend Mario Ä?aniÄ‡ (pygi) wrote a very interesting article on what he calls a &amp;ldquo;broken on birth&amp;rdquo; attitude towards DVCS adoption in many open source groups. I was very intrigued as to how one would allow different developers use their own (i.e. favorite) DVCS to work on their project, and yet be able to pool everything together in order to release a given set? If you want to learn about his ideas, about GitoriousKDE or have some relevant feedback for him, drop him a line.</description>

      <description>Last week I received an invitation to join the LXDE project, &amp;ldquo;an extremely faster, performing and energy saving desktop environment maintained by an international community of developers&amp;rdquo;, to collaborate and help organize their translation effort. As I have maintained the Brazilian Portuguese translation for Openbox, one of the components that make up LXDE, and am very much involved with the translation of GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and other modules, I felt very compelled to accept the invitation.</description>

      <description>BillReminder has attracted a new enthusiast who has brought a lot of interesting ideas to the mailing list. The coolest part is that we both share a lot of ideas in common and I have already started to write some code to pave the way to more reporting and some true home accounting features.  After spending some time changing the charting module from the hamster-applet project to do what I needed, I came to learn about a pretty cool project for graphing with Cairo and Python called CairoPlot!</description>

      <description>Been quite busy at work these days, as well as playing the host to my parents during the holidays. I did keep up with what was happening around the world, thanks to my G1 (I love this gadget!), and wanted to share a few nice nuggets.
 First of all, the birth of Lotte, the online translation editor! This new feature will help the Transifex guys deliver a fatal 1,2 punch combination in the fight against bad translation tools and processes!</description>

      <description>After battling for a few days with a certain free (as in non-proxy-ed) wifi AP, I experienced approximately 5 minutes of unlimited freedom right after lunch. My friend Kelvin and I had spent a good chunk of our morning trying to figure out why the connection was dropping all the time but to no avail. I did some &amp;ldquo;googling&amp;rdquo; around and saw that some people have been complaining about the same problem but for me this only happens at this certain AP.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Watch Me Throw the Ball&amp;quot; An Elephant &amp;amp; Piggie Book by Mo Willems is a wonderful book! I simply love the way Mo Willems writes the dialogs between Gerald, the always cautious and pessimistic elephant and Piggie, an optimistic, lovable pig.</description>

      <description>I was extremely sad to find out over the weekend that the always lovable Jorge Castro has decided to take a back seat in the Gnu/Linux world. I had a chance to meet him over the UDS-MTV and was very impressed by his genuine interest and willingness to &amp;ldquo;make the world a better place.&amp;rdquo; (c) It is very unfortunate that we have so many people out there who rather spill poison than use their energy to be constructive!</description>

      <description>Today I fixed issue 1864094 &amp;ldquo;Time widget for individual alarms are too long&amp;rdquo;. I ended up creating a brand new widget with gtk.SpinButtons instead of gtk.ComboBoxes, since we determined that it would be useful for a different dialog. This took me a bit longer than I expected because I insisted that the hours should be zero padded (i.e. display 01, 02 and not 1, 2, etc). After spending some time on this I finally gave him and asked Johan Dahlin if it was possible, to which I received a negative answer.</description>

      <description>Recently MeetUp, a then free group organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay $19 a month to use their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for the Northern NJ Linux Meetup I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean the end of the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we&amp;rsquo;ve had so far (with the exception of the day I brought someone from Ubuntu Linux to gives us a talk&amp;hellip; that day we had 7 members!</description>

 As the old-timers among you know, I periodically ask the IT consultants the gross annual or hourly pay you receive from your respective consultant firm. This information helps us determine the salary range and level of equity among the consultants of each work type/skill set; check that the consultant firm margins are somewhat reasonable, etc.</description>

      <description>My post about the bombing of Nagasaki yesterday seems to have caused quite the stir. As in any of my posts, the text contained within these pages are solely my own thoughts and oppinions. I have received quite a few comments yesterday, most disagreeing with my point of view, a few very personal, but that was expected. After the 30th comment came in this morning, I decided to lock it since I felt it had fulfilled its purpose beyond my expectations.</description>

      <description>For the volunteers working in the translation of Ubuntu Linux from English to a different language, here is a great tool based on AJAX: AJAX Translator
To use it, simply select the language that you want to translate from in the upper textbox and the language that you want to translate to in the lower textbox made, and what the &amp;ldquo;magic&amp;rdquo; unfold! The translation happens dynamicaly as you type! Though a bit too literal, I find it to be of great help.</description>

      <description>Following the trend of computer companies shipping GNU/Linux pre-installed hardware, Shuttle announced yesterday that they too will ship their XPC model with Foresight GNU/Linux! The official release note can be read here, as well as some provocative comments on the reason why they chose this &amp;ldquo;little known&amp;quot; distribution.

Having seen one of these boxes up and close already, it was fairly cool to see a system that just works out of the box.</description>

      <guid>https://omaciel.github.io/posts/almost-200-new-translations-for-billreminder-/</guid>
      <description>Amazing! There&amp;rsquo;s no other better way to describe the turn around for the translation progress of BillReminder after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post/pledge! In less than 24 hours there were 8 new translations available bringing the total of available translations now to 17! Awesome! I want to thank every single person who took the time to lend me a hand!
During the course of merging the new stuff into the repository, I was a bit confused as far as the work flow for people who have their projects hosted on Launchpad but not necessarily host the source codein their bzr servers.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I wonder how certain people get employed&amp;hellip; really! I usually get drilled with a bunch of technical questions in every job interview I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to (with the exception of a couple where the hiring manager had absolutely no clue about IT&amp;hellip; this re-enforces me original point!) and feel that I really have to show &amp;ldquo;what I&amp;rsquo;m made of.&amp;rdquo; In the meantime, some people get hired and surprisingly manage to keep their jobs whilst they lack (IMNSHO) the knowledge and skills.</description>

I just took some time off from work to respond to a few comments left on my blog about my use of the word America as a synonim for the country United States of America.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very proud to announce that today I have become a citizen of the United States! About 16 years ago my parents left or sold everything they owned and came to America with the intention of giving my sisters and I a better life. Their journey began like some many other immigrant&amp;rsquo;s in NYC. With only a few thousand dollars in their pockets and a very basic knowledge of English, my parents immediately embraced the American way of life.</description>

      <description>After a very, very, very long time I can finally announce another Foresight Linux release! We have gone through a lot of changes and it took us a while to rebuild our developer/maintainer/user base, but here we are! The goal is to go back to having a rolling release schedule and keep bringing the latest and greatest mix of GNOME and applications!

      <description>It is with an enormous pleasure that I come to announce the birth of PhPlanet, the first (if I&amp;rsquo;m not mistaken) 100% Open Source blog agregator written by a Brazilian for Brazilians! Using the Planet program as source of inspiration, PhPlanet already shows many new features such as:
Web based administration:
 Add feeds (authors) Approve feeds enrolled for the site Modify authors&#39; information Add, remove and/or edit Hackergotchis Feeds (RSS and Atom) Archiving of all posts for later retrieval (MySQL) Registration of new feeds Sending of posts via email (optional)&amp;hellip;  For a complete list of the all innovations, check the project&amp;rsquo;s home page and take a look at the live demo page (sure, it is written in portuguese but check out the functionality).</description>

      <description>I figured, why not whip up a quick sample code to show off the genericlist I just published? So I chose the Tasks application, written in C/C++, as my target. A few minutes later, my &amp;ldquo;port&amp;rdquo; was born:

Bigger picture here.
The application to the left is the one I whipped up&amp;hellip; the one to the right is the real deal! Obviously I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother writing up the code to actually store information, and this exercise was meant to be like the penguins in the movie &amp;ldquo;The Wild&amp;quot;&amp;hellip; to look cute and cuddly.</description>

      <description>Ha! Planet Gnome and Planet KDE have played their April Fools trick on me today. Apparently they&amp;rsquo;ve switched their DNS entries (or whatever it is that is required) so that people visiting Planet Gnome will be directed to Planet KDE (but the URL still says planet.gnome.org) and vice-versa! I refreshed my page a couple of times untill I realized what had happened! Good one guys!
Update: Just noticed that Planet Debian has changed their Debian logo for an Ubuntu&#39;s.</description>

On the other front, I received a nice little present from the Openbox guys: a way to inspect and honor files found in /etc/xdg/autostart by default when starting Openbox. Now, I cannot claim that this is a done deal but I&amp;rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed!</description>

Unfortunately Ken could not make it and I was left with the daunting task of talking to people about conary.
My flight was pretty peaceful with a quick stop in NYC where I met up with my older sister.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last posted anything new. That&amp;rsquo;s because I took some time off from work and headed down to my old stomping grounds&amp;hellip; Brazil! It had been 5 years since I visited my friends and relatives and since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it to GUADEC and take my family on vacation at the same time, we hoped on a straight flight to Rio de Janeiro from Charlotte&#39;s international airport.</description>

      <description>Feeling a bit rusty with your linux skills? Are you a new Ubuntu linux user and feel overwelmed with packaging managers, gpg keys, and IRC lingo? Well, the solution is right around the corner. The folks at New User Network have launched the Ubuntu Classroom, a project aimed at delivering good, live didatic material to all users, new and &amp;ldquo;seasoned.&amp;rdquo;
Some classes have already been scheduled for the month of August and there are some open slots for instructors.</description>

      <description>Remember my last post about the comic strip my friend Karlisson Bezerra created to explain how Creative Commons licenses work? Well, over this weekend I was talking to him and offered to translate one of my favorite strips to English (here&amp;rsquo;s the original in Brazilian Portuguese). I always get a kick out of this one and hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it too!

There is a place where the beer flows like wine. Where beautiful women instinctively flock like the salmon of Capistrano. It is true! I have seen it with my own eyes! No, it is not Aspen, CO. It&amp;rsquo;s a little Russian liquor around the block from where my dad lives, with walls completely covered with&amp;hellip; you guessed it, beer!
Armed with a plastic basket and the eagerness of a kid turned loose in a candy store, I worked my way through the aisles, jaw dropped to the floor and eyes fixated on the smorgasbord of colored bottles of different shapes and colors, trying to figure out the optimal battle plan.</description>

      <description>Before I go into a major rant attack against Macromedia (or whatever they&amp;rsquo;re called these days) for not doing a better job at providing open source-friendly versions of their software, I&amp;rsquo;d like to ask my fellow Linux users the following:
Is there a way of running ShockWaveÃ‚Â under Linux without the aid of emulators???
I wish people would be more considerate (or do a better job at researching alternatives out there) and use open standards when providing their services to users via the web!</description>

      <description>Last night I decided to work on my plan of racking up World of Warcraft hours in order to beef up my character but since my friend Vinny was busy with his own quests, I decided to try my newly learned skill: fishing! As stupid as this may sound, I never thought that fishing in a game could be so&amp;hellip; relaxing! I switched my character&amp;rsquo;s sword for a fishing pole and spent a good 15 minutes casting the line and watching the bobber.</description>

Also, they&amp;rsquo;ve added the ability to write emails using rich text features, such as: Bold, Italics, Underline, Select a special font, Font Size, Font Color, Background Color, Remove Formatting, Hyperlink Text, Numbered List, Bulleted List, Indent Less, Indent More, Quote Text, Left Align, Center Align, Right Align.</description>

Just in time before the new year, it is with great pleasure that I announce the release of BillReminder &amp;ldquo;Keep Their Heads Ringing&amp;quot; 0.4.0 after a 27-month hiatus! During this period I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve the user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you should have a good time playing with it.</description>

      <description>Release soon, release often they say, right? Well, here it is then!
Today I released version &amp;ldquo;7 Different Types of Smoke&amp;rdquo; (beta) 0.1 of my pet project BillReminder. Born out my need for a simple and light home accounting desktop application, BillReminder became my favorite hobbie and main learning entrance into the python world for me!

Though still in beta, this version includes an attempt at a smart database layer (built on top of sqlite) which should allow the application to expand its capabilities of saving different types of data.</description>

      <description>It is with a great pleasure that I announce the release of my pet project BillReminder! The road to 0.3 has been a very educational journey for me, and looking back when I first decided to port my original code written in C# to Python just so that I could learn more about Python, I can say that I have learned quite a bit. I have also met some fabulous people along the way, some of them very responsible for me keeping the project going.</description>

      <description>Boy was I surprised when someone told me that BillReminder was a Featured Linux Download on LifeHacker! Wow!!! There were also articles on New Linux User and Productive Linux. Thank you all for taking the time to test it and recommend it too!
Some people have asked me if it is necessary to keep BillReminder running in order to get notifications, and the answer is: no. BillReminder has a daemon that runs in the background and will only poke you (with the baseball bat) if there&amp;rsquo;s something late or close to being late.</description>

If the resolution is too crappy you may want to see the original file (approx. 6MB).
Oh!!! Before I forget, check out the spiffy Screenshots page! Thanks Luiz and VinÃƒÂ­cius for your hard work!

      <description>My pet project BillReminder has gone through several iterations of new code these last few days, mainly thanks to the work done by Luiz Armesto. All this commotion made me finally move the project&amp;rsquo;s home page, then hosted by SourceForge, to one of my domains. This has given me more flexibility and control over the overall design and look and feel of it.
Speaking of look and feel, I have received some spiffy artwork (namely, the header) from VinÃƒÂ­cius Amaral who was fairly excited about the project.</description>

Also, thanks to Diogo Autilio and Alex Bevilacqua we now have BillReminder packaged for Ubuntu Gutsy! Please take them (there are 2 *.debs available) for a spin and relate any bugs or feature requests here.</description>

      <description>Due to the proximity to the release date for Dapper Drake, Ubuntu Linux&amp;rsquo;s latest version scheduled to be released this June first, I have completely stopped working on my pet project, BillReminder. The translation effort to bring Open Source goodness to the Brazilian masses has a higher priority in my agenda, but the coding itch is still there!
BillReminder is completely written in C#/Mono and makes use of the newly incorporated Windows.</description>

So I&amp;rsquo;ll join in the fun and will announce a couple of my favorite Brazilian blogs. Just a little display that Brazilians have much more to offer than Carnaval, beautifull women, and soccer players:</description>

Taking a day off tomorrow to fly to NYC with my oldest daughter so we can both attend this year&amp;rsquo;s Book Expo America (BEA) at the Javits Center. We&amp;rsquo;re both very excited about this chance of seeing so many books and the possibility of meeting some of the authors, such as Mo Willems! Unfortunately I&amp;rsquo;m going to miss meeting James Dashner as he&amp;rsquo;s scheduled to give out sample chapters of his upcoming book only on Wednesday.</description>

What a great day to kick of the day! Just received my complimentary copy of the book &amp;ldquo;Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging&amp;quot; from Packt Publishing! From the book&amp;rsquo;s overview page:
 Develop Django applications quickly with fewer bugs through effective use of automated testing and debugging tools. Ensure your code is accurate and stable throughout development and production by using Django&amp;rsquo;s test framework.</description>

I was looking for some material on proper python testing in order to improve my QA skills and after some &amp;ldquo;Googling&amp;rdquo; came across &amp;ldquo;Python Testing: Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&amp;rdquo;. My first impulse was to hit Amazon and see if they had it and if I could buy an ebook version. Sadly, they only had the &amp;ldquo;dead tree&amp;rdquo; version, so I decided to check if the publisher, PackT Publishing, had an alternative.</description>

Back when I purchased my ebook version of â€œPython Testing: Beginnerâ€™s Guideâ€œby Daniel Arbuckle, I also snagged a copy of &amp;ldquo;Django 1.0 Website Development&amp;quot; by Ayman Hourieh.
Once again, I have to tip my head to the folks at Packt Publishing for their decision of selling ebooks and not password protecting them, giving you complete control over your purchase!!! You can alsocopy text from it, which makes your life really easy when youâ€™re following along and want to copy some of the code being described!</description>

During this last weekend I finally managed to reserve a couple of hours of &amp;ldquo;me time&amp;rdquo; to finish reading my complimentary copy of the book â€œDjango 1.1 Testing and Debuggingâ€? from Packt Publishing!
Once again I felt completely absorbed by the style chosen for this Packt Publishing book, as it makes use of a complete application to reinforce all of the topics covered.</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have looked hard for a Python book on object oriented programming (OOP) but I was immediately attracted to the title of this book. Sure, you can find small tutorials here and there about some specific facet of OOP but I don&amp;rsquo;t recall ever reading something that covers designing public interfaces using abstraction, encapsulation, etc, etc with good and practical examples!</description>

It is very rare to find a book that covers testing in the software world. Testing is something that authors will briefly mention on programming books and if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky you may even find a couple of lines of code related to the subject. So it was with great excitement that I purchasedÂ &amp;ldquo;Python Testing: Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&amp;quot;by Daniel Arbuckle!.
For the longest time I have wanted to start wrapping my code in testing functions so to improve the quality and reliability of what I write here at work.</description>

I got back from the Boston Summit around 22:00 Sunday evening and by the time I arrived home from the airport I was too tired to write up a blog post. Then Monday morning came and after all the meetings, work and side projects, I decided to spend some quality time with my kids, as I had not seen them since Friday evening.
The second day was very busy and full of things to do and interesting discussions.</description>

      <description>Have spent the last 3-4 days re-designing Wicked Reader. I completely got rid of the RSS.NET backend and wrote a brand new one from scratch. RSS.NET is a great library to get you started and may even be just what the doctor ordered depending on your project. However, I found myself tweaking it and completely taking it apart in order to get what I needed. Last Friday, frustrated of doing so many modifications and spending quite some time writing code to conform with the library, I decided enough was enough.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately the match between Brazil and Argentina was not broadcasted here in the United States (well, at least not here where I live). Out of nowhere my dad calls me from NY to tell me he had just seen this guy plug the TV in his pub to the net to watch the game. I quickly wrote down the url to the site: http://www.justin.tv

The feed wasn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest (quality-wise) from the Peruvian TV, but for those who really wanted to watch the game it was bliss!</description>

We stayed for about 2 hours and just as I was about to leave, Yv (my oldest daughter) decided she wanted to paint a pumpkin before heading back home. So we stayed a bit longer and that is when the DJ (yes, there was a DJ as well) announced there would be a pumpkin painting contest for the kids.</description>

This is usefull when you have to perform an initialization to a class member no matter what constructor is called during the class&#39; initialization. I faintly remembered Java&amp;rsquo;s Base and SuperBase(?) syntax and tried several combinations of this and base keywords. Nothing seemed to work&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s when I came across this post which gave me the answer:</description>

My good friend Vinny introduced me toÂ After the Deadline, aÂ nifty WordPress and Firefox plugin that promises to &amp;ldquo;ï»¿help you write better by adding spell, style, and grammar checking to web applications.&amp;rdquo;
As some of you know I have been on a writing rampage these last few weeks, and as in everything that I ever do, I try my best to write concise, clear and well written articles.</description>

      <description>Well, so far nobody who read this blog (contrary to the portuguese version) has signed up for the Ubuntu Sweepstakes 2005! My other blog seems to be fairing much better though and 3 people have officially signed up! Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending way too much time handling the Ubuntu translation and such, and not getting enough exposure among the english-speaking folks?
On an unrelated note, I just learned a new way for feeling relaxed all day long!</description>

The idea of doing a podcast is something that has tickled my [STRIKEOUT:curiosity] fancy for quite some time. As a matter of fact, I am already the survivor of 2 other mildly successful attempts, which sadly, died prematurely due to commitment issues from my partners and my inability to record and edit audio using Linux.
About 6 months ago the need to scratch this itch came back in full power, and thanks to the support of my friend Evandro Pastor, Castálio Podcast was born!</description>

      <description>It seems that my post didn&amp;rsquo;t quite express what I really meant and some people (Olav Vitters has asked me to mention his name instead of making it generic) have even decided no to vote for me because of it. Wow&amp;hellip; For instance, my good friend Luis quoted me on his last post and based on what he wrote one would think I&amp;rsquo;m telling people to shut up and just vote.</description>

I first got hooked on drinking coffee back in the Spring of 1994 while attending a Microbiology class at Pace University. Our class started way too early for me and our professor (can&amp;rsquo;t remember her name right now) was this tiny old lady who barely raised her voice over the decibel level that dogs can hear. The class and subject were very interesting and by the end of the semester I felt very confident about my laboratory skills (and developed a phobia about anything that was not coated with some type of anti bacterial product).</description>

      <description>Been talking to someone from work quite extensive about Linux, Mono and C# these last 4 days. So much in fact that I looked back at my old pet project, Comic Buddy#. This had been a VB6 application I had written several years ago to allow me to browse all/any Calvin and Hobbes or Garfield comic strip that were (back then) freely available online. These comics, together with many others are still housed and fiercely maintained by a group (the company name and web site url left out on purpose) that has recently changed their policies concerning the viewing of said strips.</description>

 Do people really believe that the goal of the terrorists is to destroy our freedom? Or that they hate our way of life? (E.g, Tony BlairÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarks). IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be interested to know the origin of this themeÃ¢â‚¬â€?at some point, the cold war anti-Soviet rhetoric was somehow adapted to the war on terror.</description>

 If they succeed with this migration Cuba will become (I believe) the first nation to completely go Open Source! Maybe Brazil will be next???</description>

I was hanging out in the lobby of the Catalina Park Appartments last week writing some code when I was approached by Diederik van der Boor (of KMess fame) who was also hacking away and had a question about Git.
 Diederik: are you an expert on git by any chance? Me: hardly, but what is the question? Diederik: I just made a few changes to a single file and was wondering if it is possible to commit specific chunks?</description>

My daughter&amp;rsquo;s daycare was closed today due to the weather. Eventhough there&amp;rsquo;s less than 2 inches of snow on the ground they decided that it was safer not to open today. I think they just used a very lame excuse to have a day off and since they get paid no matter what, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt them in the pocket.
So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.</description>

I can only imagine future archeologists performing &amp;ldquo;cyber-digs&amp;rdquo; in order to study civilizations from our time. Why travel to Egypt if you can uncover everything there is to know about the pyramids from the confort of your house using Google search and maps?</description>

It pains me to know that even today with all the technological and intellectual progress we&amp;rsquo;ve made, there are people out there who just cannot accept and/or respect other people&amp;rsquo;s choices.
For those hiding behind a bible to defend their actions, maybe your god should teach you more tolerance&amp;hellip;
Yeah, comments will be turned off. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to spend my day fending off any comment that will tell me that their rights are more important that somebody else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I pimped my Django Dev Kit Appliance, mostly because I have been really busy with work, projects and my kid&amp;rsquo;s end of the school year. Anyhow, I rebuilt the appliance to use the latest Django 1.3 release plus several other updated packages such as git and mercurial. I have also stopped building Amazon EC2 images and will from now on only provide ISOs and Raw Filesystem images.</description>

I rebuilt the appliance to use the latest Django 1.3.1 release to deliver the security fixes found in the previous version. There are also several other updated packages included.
If you want to play with this appliance, feel free to download it in the following formats:
 Django DevKit Raw Filesystem x86 (390 MB - SHA1: 3ae0ab73477be3308011735aac5b33908700a82d) Django DevKit Raw Filesystem x86_64 (411 MB - SHA1: 3fb040a9b48b0dc248e5424271d4ea9274605530) Django DevKit ISO x86 (517 MB - SHA1: 88d5f1065bf5646d7cd952e8ccac435a40176fef) Django DevKit ISO x86_64 (537 MB - SHA1: cee9f5f584261d69baca09efeb58278d23cab410)  Speaking of Raw Filesystem images, here&amp;rsquo;s how I currently use it with QEMU.</description>

      <description>Once again, I see my chance of relocating to Chapel Hill, NC crumble down at the last second&amp;hellip; This time around the prospect was much better than the previous one: same compensation as I have now at a fast-paced software development company. I even had all the required skills! What really ticks me is that after the initial phone blitz from the recruiter he just left me hanging for 3 days&amp;hellip; until I emailed him to pretty much say &amp;ldquo;throw me a friggin&#39; bone here!</description>

      <description>Been really busy attending the Project Management class these last 3 days. It&amp;rsquo;s been very interesting but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of material and concepts to absorb. The end product of this is that I get home completely drained and just pass out! Been &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; off of a million cups of coffee and caffeinated snacks&amp;hellip; Still haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to play with Perforce and have 4 new books awaiting for me at home.</description>

      <description>It has been a while since I last wrote about my TabletPC.Ã‚Â About 2-3 weeks ago I managed to install Edgy Knot 1 on it and everything was a-OK!Ã‚Â That&amp;rsquo;s when the rug was pulled from under me and I was kindly asked to return my precious.Ã‚Â Turns out my friend, who lent me the Tablet, had no authority to do so, and asked me to return it.Ã‚Â I confess, I was sad to see it go get a make over and become someone else&amp;rsquo;s new toy&amp;hellip;</description>

Also did some serious hacking on my new, upcoming application&amp;hellip; Life is good! Looking forward to doing some more hacking over the weekend and BBQ&amp;rsquo;ing. Will also try to rack up some more levels with my WoW character.</description>

      <description>Shortly after receiving a comment on my other blog (Brazilian Portuguese only) from Armando Silva about an educational Live CD, my curiosity got the best of me and I just had to check it out.
The first thing I did was point my browser to the Brazilian GCompris site and I was imediately impressed by their stated objectives of promoting the translation and documentation of education software in Brazil
A few more paragraphs later I found out that Armando Silva himself was responsible for this Live CD, based on Knoppix with components from Kanotix e Sidux.</description>

For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t read any &amp;ldquo;geek news&amp;rdquo; or avoid any conversations that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to music videos or movies: Wired magazine published an article in this month&amp;rsquo;s issue about &amp;ldquo;How four underdogs from the mean streets of Phoenix took on the best from M.</description>

      <description>Just an update on the development for BillReminder. Real life and work took a good hold of me these last 2 months and I had not been able to stick to my personal roadmap&amp;hellip; that is, until last week. The programming itch attacked me again, and the result was several commits along the week, completly stripping BillReminder of its Glade &amp;ldquo;skin&amp;rdquo; and re-writing a lot of the code.

I must tell you, I am very happy with the outcome so far&amp;hellip; The applications &amp;ldquo;feels&amp;rdquo; snapier and I am learning a lot of new things along the way too!</description>

The novel will be available completely free of charge, no strings attached! To top it off, being the nice guy that he is, he&amp;rsquo;s also setting up a donation system to take advantage of the traffic that his web site will most like generate so that you can support a charity of your choice!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m the proud father of two voracious young readers! From very early on I was able to instill into my daughters the pleasure of reading books. They also happen to be girly girls, so while most kids ask for toys and video games for their birthdays, mine ask for books and clothes/shoes!
During thirdÂ grade my oldest daughterÂ happened to pick up &amp;ldquo;Emma&amp;rsquo;s very busy week&amp;quot; by Heather Dakota from herÂ school&amp;rsquo;s library and just couldn&amp;rsquo;t put it down!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s was the end of the year and my head has been spinning with ideas! The important thing is to know how to take advantage of this and try to turn them into reality. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using online systems like Remember The Milk(RTM) to help me get more organized. Since I check my gMail at least a good 50 times a day, and RTM integrates well with it, I won&amp;rsquo;t have any excuses if I forget something now.</description>

Woke up this morning to find the following email in my inbox:
Renew membership of Og Maciel in Ubuntu Members
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last thought about this membership so this email had me thinking for a bit. Ubuntu is where everything started for me, and even though I have not seen eye to eye with Canonical, I harbor no ill feelings toward the distribution itself.</description>

Every Wednesday night has been &amp;ldquo;Enemy Territory Night&amp;rdquo; for Vinny and I for quite some time now. I&amp;rsquo;m a confessed E.T. addict and have been known for taking just any free second I can squeeze out of my tight daily agenda just so I can play a little bit. Tonight is the only time during the week when I can forego my house chores so I can solely concentrate on the game.</description>

Anyhow, here&amp;rsquo;s some more background on ENFP &amp;ldquo;personalities&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; Anyone who knows me personally agree/disagree with it?

      <description>One other reason why I haven&amp;rsquo;t been blogging much these days is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing every little bit of free time I have reading up on business and economics. This must be a shock for those who have known me for a while. I had never, ever in my 31 years of age cared about either subject. My perspective about money was that of something that was too hard to get and keep!</description>

      <description>I just have to agree with Foresight&#39;s decision to ship the Epiphany web browser as their default browser! DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get me wrong, I like Firefox and some of the very nifty extensions make some of my tasks a breeze (Firebug rules!), but Epiphany IS GNOME&amp;rsquo;s default web broswer!
I say, take it for a spin and you&amp;rsquo;ll see how pleasant your experience will be!</description>

      <description>Ever since I wrote my last post about the state of Epiphany as the default web browser for Gnome, I completely switched from Firefox to it!Ã‚Â Cold turkey!Ã‚Â I must tell you, there are certain things which can be annoying at times&amp;hellip;Ã‚Â But the sheer speed I have gained while performing my web surfing &amp;ldquo;duties&amp;rdquo; is more than enough justification as to why I will keep using it for now.Ã‚Â Thanks to some great comments I received, I am now subscribed to their mailing list and have solved some of my initial issues by installing the epiphany-extensions package.</description>

      <description>A while back my friend Karlisson Bezerra, author of the Brazilian comic (all using open source tools such as Inkscape, etc) Nerdson, created a pretty nifty story explaining how to use the Creative Commons license. The original strip was written in Brazilian Portuguese but someone took the time to do a quick translation into English (as the translator is not a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker, some things got lost in the translation, but the end result is still worth checking).</description>

      <description>Interesting how it is relatively easy to follow what someone is reading, listening, going/seeing, all via RSS. If you have a Mugshot account and their client installed, then it is even easier to follow this information. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned of different bands/music thanks to these feeds. I only use a couple of these &amp;ldquo;social networking&amp;rdquo; sites, so you could only imagine how much more information is available out there.</description>

First off, I was one of those who up until 5 years ago wanted nothing to do with politics&amp;hellip; not only that, I was also happy with being a green card holder and saw no advantages in becoming a citizen.</description>

This will only happen if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled Ubuntu Backports in your apt-get setup. Luckly, Cyphase took the time to write up a small HowTo that will help you fix this minor glitch. For the console-afficionado out there just execute:
sudo apt-get remove firefox firefox-gnome-support mozilla-firefox mozilla-firefox-gnome-support sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox mozilla-firefox-gnome-support</description>

It took place at the local Panera Bread in Paramus and I had to drive like a lunatic through traffic, afraid I was going to be late for it. Turns out traffic wasn&amp;rsquo;t as bad and I managed to arrive 30 minutes earlier.</description>

 Here is the report of todays Community Council Meeting
 General Items Bhuvan suggested that the RSS feed of the wiki RecentChanges page should be advertized more. This is going to happen. The options for reducing the stress on the CC meetings by (partially) delegating membership approvals have been discussed.</description>

      <description>Sunday I was lucky enough to have the chance of attending a book reading (well, a passage actually) by Cory Doctorow! The event took place at Flyleaf Books right here in Chapel Hill, a charming independent book store that will most definitely see me and my kids more often from now on (plus, they&amp;rsquo;re right next to Foster&amp;rsquo;s Market and Flying Burrito)!
Cory came across as a very humble, down to earth kind of guy and it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for the crowed to feel right at home.</description>

You can download the entire book (approx. 15MB) on individual chapters in PDF format. Now, if Microsoft would only release the bloody thing already! ;) If anyone know of a similar book for C#, please post back.</description>

Bruce Kroeze suggested using Django&amp;rsquo;s shell to resolve this common issue and one of the comments his post received nailed it:
[omaciel@crutches souschef]$ python manage.py shell Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Mar 22 2010, 10:30:12) Type &amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;credits&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;license&amp;quot; for more information. IPython 0.10 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.</description>

      <description>Literally! Spent an agonizing sleep-less night after my surgery yesterday. My keloids were removed with a CO2 laser and whatever if left of my earlobes feel as if I had deep fried them in boiling sulfuric acid! Drinking an extremely cold Cappuccino Blast from Donkey Donuts helped a bit but later in the evening it was a mix of 2 extra stregth Tylenols + 1 Motrin that helped ease the pain.</description>

I have been playing Enemy Territory every Wednesday night since last Summer with a few cancellations here and there. Earlier this year Vinny convinced me to try World of Warcraft, a very addictive online multiplayer game. I was hooked from the start but not being able to &amp;ldquo;dedicate&amp;rdquo; to more than a couple of hours a week I eventually lost interest.</description>

      <description>Last week I started using the text editor and IDE Geany for the first time, and I was pleasantly surprised with it! Obviously, there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big number of text editors out there that with the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; number of enabled would turn an ordinary editor to a super-on-steroids IDE, but I felt Geany to be a very light and fast option, with a couple of nice features already enabled by default.</description>

      <description>Quite a few people have asked me to publish my attempt at simplifying the process of creating and using a Gtk.TreeView (see this post). The truth is that life has been a bit hectic these last 5-6 weeks and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to do any more development on it. But I think it is still very usefull, even if only as a learning aid. The code will be published to a few repositories very soon, but in the meantime, you can copy it inline right here (read the rest of this post).</description>

      <description>A few years back I created the irc channel #tradutores (translators in Brazilian Portuguese) on the Freenode server, a place where anyone involved with the translation process of open source software could hang out, chat, ask questions and share their experience with other fellow translators. A place with no association to a given project or distribution, where you could find people working for several groups such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Fedora, Foresight, Ubuntu, all sharing the same goal: improve the quality of open source translations for Brazilian Portuguese!</description>

Sure they&amp;rsquo;ve added a few sweetners to the deal, but why not then create a single, clean piece of legislation to deal with the major issue?</description>

The online classes were held every evening at #ubuntu-br-tradutores, and covered all the steps and methods involved in the process of translating Ubuntu to Brazilian Portuguese, as well as showing people how they can participate in the community.. The very last session, taught by CÃƒÂ¡ssio Martini (and me in the back stage), was performed with live demos and participation of the &amp;ldquo;students&amp;rdquo; in real time.</description>

      <description>So today is my birthday and I&amp;rsquo;m now 34. It is also my mother&amp;rsquo;s birthday, and as she&amp;rsquo;s been having some health issues, I decided to surprise her and drive up to NJ/NY. For the first time the trip went really smooth and it only took me 8 1/2 hours to get here. The very first thing I did, and you&amp;rsquo;re going to laugh at this, was to buy some Chinese food!</description>

Git In The Trenches, or GITT is a pretty cool project by my friend Peter Savage, &amp;ldquo;designed to be a book that focusses on teaching people to use Git by associating with scenarios that are experienced by a fictional company called Tamagoyaki Inc. Through reading about their day to day lives, the reader will learn not only how to use Git, but why version control systems are important and how to implement them within an organisation.</description>

      <description>We did it!
/me does Dora, the Explorer&#39;s dance!
GNOME 2.18 Desktop Applications are now completely translated to Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to the colaborative work between the Ubuntu and GNOME Brazilian teams! Now, the Ubuntu team will be working hard to make sure that everything is in sync so that Ubuntu Feisty Fawn will have a default look and feel in our language as well!

I want to take this chance to congratulate all the hard work done by both teams, and recognize that together we removed a lot of redundancy in the process.</description>

      <description>GNOME 2.20 just came out of the oven and is as crispy as you&amp;rsquo;d expect it to be after a couple of months of development! This is the second release I take part of (not as a developer but as a translator), and want to take the opportunity to thank all of those who participated in this effort!

I want to specially thank (and give a shout out to) the entire GNOME i18n team!</description>

Hey, are you feverishly working on the translation for the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release? Do you find yourself often wondering how a certain word was translated across the entire desktop applications? Well, I do and this is why I developed Pylyglot, a Django-driven localization tool that let&amp;rsquo;s you search for a word and see how it has been translated for a given language. The plan is to have fresh data straight from the GNOME git repositories every Monday for now, eventually switching to a more frequent update schedule.</description>

First off, congratulations to everyone involved in the release of GNOME 3.0! In the past, my contributions were mostly related to translating applications to Brazilian Portuguese, but my role on that front was very minimal this time and consisted of a handful of translations and several commits of the awesome work done by others. Most of my contributions for 3.0 are related to the work I do for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors, but I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you to tears!</description>

Today I attended my very first GNOME Board of Directors meeting. Though I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to vote on issues until July 1st, it was great to witness how the process works and be able to ask questions and receive answers directly from current and former board members.
I must say that the entire meeting felt very streamlined and ran smoothly, partially because of people like Vincent, Brian, GermÃ¡n and Paul who seem to be on top of everything and juggling several balls at the same time!</description>

      <description>UPDATE: Thanks Alberto Ruiz for pointing out that VirtualBox can use .vmdk files, so the VMware image can be used for that purpose.
Thanks to the incredible work of `Zhang &amp;ldquo;Jesse&amp;rdquo; Sen &amp;lt;http://blog.zhangsen.org/&amp;gt;`__ and Vladimir Melo, a brand new release of the **GNOME Developer Kit** has been published! &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s new&amp;rdquo;, you may ask? Everything, since all packages are built directly from git.gnome.org! :) But that alone is not what makes this release so cool, but the fact that the final image went through a dramatic &amp;ldquo;diet&amp;rdquo;, shedding a lot of its &amp;ldquo;weight&amp;rdquo; and going from a 1.</description>

      <description>I was extremely pleased to see my application for the GNOME Foundation approved. I have spent the last 9 months working very closely with the localization teams, making sure all work being done by the Ubuntu Brazilian team is submitted upstream first for all GNOME packages! I&amp;rsquo;ve also been very vocal about a unified Brazilian localization team, completely distro independent.
I want to thank all of those who put in a good word for me.</description>

Last November I sent out an email to pretty much every major Brazilian localization team (including Gnome, KDE, XFCE, Mozilla, OpenOffice, and the Linux Documentation Project), inviting them to a meeting to discuss how we can all benefit from our individual work. Many replies later, we decided to hold 2 sessions on the 18Th so to accommodate everyone&amp;rsquo;s schedules.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll be arriving July 3rd around lunch time and will stay until the 11th, so there will be plenty of time to meet up and discuss. I&amp;rsquo;m mostly interested in localization, accessibility, and tests automation but am equaly interested in community building and the organization toward GNOME 3.</description>

Now, I know people have hammered these types of articles to death in the net but this one sounded worth the risk of mentioning. For one thing, it covers hardening your bare-bones Debian server which, IMHO should be worth looking at no matter what.</description>

Their decision to go with WebKit plus the synchronization with GNOME&amp;rsquo;s release cycle should appeal to a lot of new developers and contributors! If we could finally get Firebug for Epiphany (this GSoC idea needs a mentor!!!) I could stop using two different browsers. :)</description>

      <description>The amazing guys at Wiley Books (and more especifically Kit and Colleen!) simply rock! I got to meet Kit at the Linux World Conference this year, and after talking for a while about Ubuntu and the new books coming out on the subject, I asked him if his organization offered any type of sponsorship in the form of giving out books. Kit was more than eager to offer me his sponsorship, and one email and a few days later, he put me directly in contact with Colleen who pretty much told me to order anything from their catalogues.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite web services ever (Open-Tran.eu) announced today what I consider to be the best feature of 2008! PERIOD! What am I talking about? I&amp;rsquo;m talking about the possibilty of viewing the comparison of how a single string was translated across several projects! You have to experience it to understand how great this is! To quote Jacek Åšliwerski, the brain behind this:
 I added new functionality to the service.</description>

      <description>Today I actually enjoyed work!!! Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to mention &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enjoy&amp;rdquo; together? I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it since early 2002 when I worked for the now defunct Synaptic Pharmaceuticals!!! I spent most of the day working on a new VB.NET application for work (something very small and simple for XML generation) and my C# (soon to become Mono) rss reader. It feels absolutely great to be back in the groove of coding!</description>

So far it&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of fun! Hope to be able to find more time and even spend some time on IRC to pick up a few tricks.</description>

      <description>After being harassed by Mario Danic for several days to submit a paper to this year&amp;rsquo;s GUADEC, I caved in and did it. I had problems completing my registration but was rescued in the last minute by Thomas Wood!
If my paper gets selecte, my talk will be titled &amp;ldquo;Where the streets have no name: Getting more done with different localizations teams!&amp;rdquo;, and it will be based on my personal experience in coordinating the joint effort by the Brazilian GNOME and Ubuntu Localization teams during our race toward a 100% GNOME 2.</description>

      <description>Though this is not a review for the book and tv show with the same title, it is about some of the topics portraid in both: The colonization of our planet and how our socio-economic make-up came to be as influenced by &amp;ldquo;guns, germs, and metal.&amp;rdquo; I had thought of writing about it before and have been procrastinating it for quite some time. I believe the reason behind this delay was because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t confident I&amp;rsquo;d be able to properly express my ideas in writing without making it sound boring or without proper foundation.</description>

      <description>I was browsing through my favorite Linux magazine (it&amp;rsquo;s Linux Format by the way&amp;hellip; I wonder if I mention it several times here on my blog if someone will send me a free subscription? What? A guy can dream, can&amp;rsquo;t he?) at a certain book store today when I came across a quick review of the game Ardentryst.

 Ardentryst is an action/RPG sidescoller, focused not just on fighting, but on story, and character development.</description>

Andre started contributing with translations quite some time ago, but for whatever reason stopped contributing for a while. One day, completely out of the blue, he approached me and asked me to lend him a hand to get started again&amp;hellip; fast forward a few years later, and Andre is without a doubt the most active and interested translator for the entire Ubuntu Brazilian team!</description>

      <description>I have! I just recently got a hold of a US$30 Amazon gift certificate for participating of a 1-hour phone study. I could have used it and bought something for me, right? Instead, I decided to present it to Jacek Åšliwerski, the guy behind Open-Tran. There is not a day that I don&amp;rsquo;t use it for my translations, as I can use its awesome comparisson tools to QA my work!</description>

      <description>I need your help to get BillReminder translated into as many different languages as possible! Up until now I have relied on a list of collaborators who know how to work with a message catalog template (i.e. pot file) and use it to generate a translated message file (i.e. po file). I&amp;rsquo;m aware that a lot of people probably don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about and/or may feel uneasy about working with text files and what not&amp;hellip; so I decided to set BillReminder up for translation via Rosetta, which can be reached here.</description>

      <description>*Sometimes, contributing back to upstream open source projects is not as straight forward as one may think. &amp;ldquo;Helping downstream translations swim upstream&amp;rdquo; will be a new series of articles where I intend to explain the issues contributors may face when attempting to send translations back to upstream projects, and hopefully, devise a couple of possible solutions.*
In the past few years we have seen an astonishing growth of companies that started using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) bits and pieces in their products.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend I finally took the first step towards my resolution to take a more active role in helping out the open source community. As of last Friday, I joined the hordes of developers and open source enthusiasts who signed up for Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s LaunchPad project and offered to help with the ongoing process of translating applications and documents from English to Portuguese (Brazil). I spoke with the organizer for this specific translation effort and was told to submit suggestions to some of the sections still pending.</description>

Thanks to comments by booxter and Patrick Niedzielski, I have added support for 2 more languages to Pylyglot: Belarusian and Esperanto! So far I had been adding languages according to their translation percentage, starting from the top and slowly moving down the list, but it probably makes sense to add some of the languages that need a bit of help catching up with the other teams and provide them with a means to check their standardization.</description>

This is the realization of a long-term dreamof mine for I&amp;rsquo;m a complete hockey fanatic and always wanted to have a web site dedicated to the sport. Being I die-hard New Jersey Devils fan, chances are most of my posts will be related to their affairs but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to live up to the blog&amp;rsquo;s title and add comments about &amp;ldquo;the other teams.</description>

Besides being busy with my daughter being sick all last week, there was a major reason for my absence: Last Friday I was phone interviewed for a job at `Microsoft &amp;lt;http://www.microsoft.com&amp;gt;`__ and afraid I&amp;rsquo;d jinx myself by telling anyone, I refrained from blogging. I&amp;rsquo;d say the interview went very well but in the end I don&amp;rsquo;t think I had everything the position required.</description>

      <description>For the second release cycle in a row, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that GNOME will be 100%* available in Brazilian Portuguese! This feat shows again how the collaborative effort between the Ubuntu and GNOME Brazilian translation teams! Since all translations were submitted and aproved by the GNOME commiters (thank you Leonardo, Raphel and Jonh!) first, every GNU/Linux distribution will be able to take advantage of effort! If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent the true meaning of cooperation and collaborative work, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what else does!</description>

But it is kind of pricey for my very limited budget right now (or for the next several months for that matter. I wonder what a translator could do to get one of those nice discounts I read about in the web? ;)</description>

      <title>Icons on menus for Openbox</title>

      <guid>https://omaciel.github.io/posts/icons-on-menus-for-openbox-/</guid>
      <description>Openbox 3.5.0 was released yesterday, and with it several bugs got fixed and a few new features were added. Out of these features the one that I liked most was the ability to add icons to menus (and submenus as well)! Yeah, I know some other managers already do this but for someone who enjoys running Openbox because of its simplicity and keyboard binding limitless possibilities, I was sure glad to see some eye candy make its way to it.</description>

      <description>I was really glad to see David Bolter&#39;s post today about transparency in community decisions! Olav and I had been talking about this (see comments section), related to blog aggregation requests, and it is nice to see that someone else also agrees. Some people may complain about having to create a user account (assuming we&amp;rsquo;re using bugzilla, for instance) to request that his blog be aggregated to the planet, but this would provide some sort of &amp;ldquo;receipt&amp;rdquo; and serve as a means to get a process going.</description>

      <description>Something interesting happened today. As my wife and I talked about the economic bailout during dinner, we didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that Yv, my soon-to-be-seven-year-old was paying close attention to what we were saying. The following is a pretty close description of the dialogue that followed:
 Yv: &amp;hellip; where are they getting US$700? Me: They&amp;rsquo;re taking the mine from us and every other family. Yv: Have they asked you if it is ok to do it?</description>

As I see our nation crumbling down before my eyes, the republican candidates to the presidency of the United States concentrated on spewing garbage about the war in Iraq and building a fence to protect us against illegal immigrants. I wish they would use their time more wisely talking about how to minimize the huge f*** up our current President has gotten us into.</description>

If I remember correctly, there weren&amp;rsquo;t a lot of usefull information &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; in the web and the few posts we (I also did some googling on the side for him) came across were either inacurate or not very newbie friendly. I remember that I borrowed his laptop this last Friday and tried some of the &amp;ldquo;recipes&amp;rdquo; but the automated installation script (don&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact location in the iWhax menu) failed miserably every single attempt.</description>

      <description>A while back I had written up a post (Brazilian Portuguese only) explaining how I managed to get PyPanel running on my old Ubuntu Feisty Herd 3 installation. The reason for the write up was to explain about how I circunvented two issues that came up during the process of getting PyPanel to actually run. Anyhow, ever since I started writing up about OpenBox, more and more people tried to use PyPanel and seem to have gotten bitten by the same problems.</description>

      <description>Everyone who works with the translation of free and open source software must know the web site Open-Tran.eu (if you don&amp;rsquo;t, I highly recommend it!), a translation repository online.
To quote Jacek, the brain behind the project:
 Proprietary software vendors may (if they can afford it) use CAT or TM software in order to ensure the consistency of their applications&#39; terminology. Unfortunately, there are many different software vendors who are not willing to share their knowledge (which includes translation memory databases) with the others.</description>

      <description>As everyone knows I&amp;rsquo;m very involved with the translation efforts of several upstream projects and try to keep up with what&amp;rsquo;s going on with every single one of them. Starting about 3 weeks ago I realized that I relied too much on statistical information that wasn&amp;rsquo;t always up to date and sometimes there would be a program that would get newer code (sometimes resulting in changes to the translation strings) and go unoticed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following a very interesting discussion that has taken place these last few days on Planet Debian about application usability and how much information exposed to a user is too much. In one end you have Axel Beckert (with some commentary support by Wouter) talking about how some of the new changes made to the Galeon web browser have actually &amp;ldquo;crippled it&amp;rdquo; for the more &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; user. On the other side of the &amp;ldquo;rink&amp;rdquo; is Erich Schubert, who believes that most users are not interested in seeing every possible configuration option a web browser has to offer.</description>

Now, I have always been outspoken about the subject of application usability.Ã‚Â I have had a few discussions about some of the changes done to the newer version of Galeon, where certain features were removed for the sake of &amp;ldquo;moms and dads&amp;rdquo; users&amp;hellip;Ã‚Â One day you&amp;rsquo;re happily using a program that you feel confortable with and attends your every need&amp;hellip; and then, after an &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; you find out (the hard way) that some features are completely &amp;ldquo;missing&amp;rdquo; from action.</description>

Over the holidays I got a second-hand Kindle DX from my sister. As I have been doing some serious reading these last couple of years, an EBook reader was something that both excited and scared me at the same time. Let me explain.
Being able to carry several books, often pretty thick and heavy, in one simple and light device has its advantages. Add to that the massive number of free EBooks and regular plain text books available on web sites such as the Internet Archive, Open Library, Project Gutenberg, and all of a sudden we&amp;rsquo;re talking about having your own private and portable library on the go!</description>

      <description>KPL, or Kid&amp;rsquo;s Programming Language
 is modeled on the simplicity and readability of BASIC, but it is a structured rather than linear programming language. KPL lets kids see eye-catching and immediate results from their programs, while teaching them fundamental concepts like variables, data types, loops, decision structures, methods and functions. KPL&amp;rsquo;s data types include integers, decimals, strings, booleans, arrays, and user-defined structures.
 Visual Studio users will feel right at home with KPL&amp;rsquo;s IDE as it will, as the web page smartly states, &amp;ldquo;graduate&amp;rdquo; young coders to the more professional interfaces.</description>

      <description>Ok, my apologies for not having written up a post on my trip to the Canary Islands and the whole experience of attending the Gran Canary Desktop Summit 2009! I think I can summarize it in one word: AWESOME! I can honestly say that I had a blast meeting a lot of the people that I only knew from irc conversations, emails and blog posts! A lot of the presentations were very interesting, some of them having that special je ne sais quoi that triggered an avalanche of new ideas for my existing projects!</description>

      <description>I really liked the new &amp;ldquo;face-lift&amp;rdquo; given to Launchpad (still in beta)&amp;hellip;
Something tells me we&amp;rsquo;ll see it being used by many companies in the near future as their management tool for&amp;hellip; well, pretty much everything?!?!?</description>

      <description>Spent a uneventful and quiet day with my dad. Played a bit of tennis in the park and had BBQ for lunch. Got an email from a friend who got free wi-fi while on the beach in Atlantic City. Bastard! :) I&amp;rsquo;m still a bit sore but managed to catch some quality Zs last night. My younger sister is in town so it should be a fun weekend.</description>

      <description>Very amusing play-by-play recount of Nat Friedman&#39;s adventorous attempt to travel from his hometown of Boston to the very tip of Cape Cod by bike! The reason: Insanity could be a great part of it, but apparently he just wants to prove someone wrong. Apparently Nat has to make it back to Boston for a party later the same evening. Updated every so often with pictures, videos, and witty comments. A must!</description>

      <description>Shameless plug ahead:
If you speak Portuguese and want to learn how to use the GIMP like the pros, I strongly recommend you check out my good friend AntÃƒÂ´nio &amp;ldquo;LedStyle&amp;rdquo; ClÃƒÂ¡udio&#39;s new project! &amp;ldquo;LedStyle&amp;rdquo; and I have worked together before doing podcasts for the Brazilian Ubuntu Planet, and my respect and admiration for him has never stopped growing!Ã‚Â I downloaded the first video (out of 10, plus all the exercise material freely available) and was very impressed by his didactic skills!</description>

      <title>Learning Inkscape?</title>

      <guid>https://omaciel.github.io/posts/so-you-want-to-learn-inkscape-/</guid>
      <description>Lately I have found myself spending more and more time playing with Inkscape, the amazing open source vector graphic editor! The main reason being that my oldest daughter has shown interest in drawing and graphic design.Â Since we only run GNU/Linux at our house, I had to choose something that was open source and available for my distribution.
My last attempt at anything remotely close to &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; was way back when in the early 1990s when a friend gave me a copy of Paint Shop Pro.</description>

      <description>Yesterday while waiting for my wife at the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, I managed to take a peek at an older issue of the American Scientist.Ã‚Â Ever since I graduated from Pace University with my BS in Biochemistry, I rarely read anything too scientific and tend to browse more computer related magazines.Ã‚Â Anyhow, the very first article, &amp;ldquo;Gauss&amp;rsquo;s Day of Reckoning&amp;quot; by Brian Hayes caught my attention:
 In the 1780s a provincial German schoolmaster gave his class the tedious assignment of summing the first 100 integers.</description>

      <description>This post is my 2 cents about Jad&amp;rsquo;s latest post trying to stir things up and attract more translators to the Ubuntu community! Having led the Brazilian team for a couple of years myself, I wanted to point out a couple of things Iâ€™ve learned along the way. Obviously advices are best taken when asked for, but here it goes anyway:
 Beware that 300 volunteers working at the same time without a robust and clear way of knowing whoâ€™s doing what will make it impossible for your team to manage; Also, with this many people contributing with single, hand picked strings is extremelly detrimental to the overal quality of the entire package, not to mention the entire suite; I have always liked the idea of contributions being done upstream first, and then tricklying it down to distros and what not.</description>

      <description>I was really bad over this weekend&amp;hellip; I not only had a cup of (gasp!) Star Bucks coffee but I also managed to convince my wife that we deserved a new flat LCD monitor to replace our existing 17-inch. We finally settled (well, actually I settled for it&amp;hellip; she wasn&amp;rsquo;t too thrilled about it&amp;hellip; hehe) for a 20.1-inch Sony model. Its UXGA 1600 x 1200 resolution is amazing!!! I have so much space on my screen now&amp;hellip; I also managed to update the driver for my G-Force 5200 card adding the final touch to a great system.</description>

&amp;quot;Let My Love Open The Door&amp;quot; Written by Pete Townshend
When people keep repeating That you&amp;rsquo;ll never fall in love When everybody keeps retreating But you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get enough
Let my love open the door Let my love open the door Let my love open the door To your heart
When everything feels all over When everybody seems unkind I bring you a four leaf clover Take all the worry out of your mind</description>

      <description>About today&amp;rsquo;s outburst, I have the following to say: The GNOME Foundation has established a democratic process by which its members and directions can be chosen. If a process or person has not delivered that which was agreed upon or expected (due to a role), that is the price one pays for democracy. Please, let us not lose out cool and take advantage of the system to do what is right for the Foundation.</description>

      <description>I just had to share this with everyone. Have a great weekend!
 Life Is a Gift Today before you say an unkind word - Think of someone who can&amp;rsquo;t speak. Before you complain about the taste of your food - Think of someone who has nothing to eat. Before you complain about your husband or wife - Think of someone who&amp;rsquo;s crying out to GOD for a companion. Today before you complain about life - Think of someone who died too early on this earth.</description>

      <description>Just added a few more links to some of my favorite sites, visited every single day, religiously! Where are Slashdot or OSNews you may ask? I have become extremelly disappointed with the quality and (lack of) variety of their articles. If you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like looking through the old list of links and try to figure out which ones are the new ones, here they are:
 Planet Debian Planet Security Planet Ubuntu  Some bloggers subscribe to multiple aggregators but you should have a lot of good material to read during your morning hours.</description>

It is the 7th meeting I have organized ever since taken over the group back in September 2004. I managed to get there earlier than usual and took advantage of the extra time to write down some ideas I had for a new pet project of mine and get some good coffee. One hour later some of the frequent attendees arrived.</description>

      <description>Linux World Expo 2005
Originally uploaded by omaciel.
So here I am standing in front of the Gnome booth. Vinny and I got here around 1-1:30pm thanks to his awsome navigational skills but were able to see every single booth. The environment was very laid back and not as &amp;ldquo;corporate&amp;rdquo; as last year&amp;rsquo;s event in NYC. We managed to ask a few questions, got a lot of cool stuff, even a complementary made-in-front-of-you latte&#39; at the CA&amp;rsquo;s booth, and just enjoyed it all.</description>

      <description>Pretty easy day today compared to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;feeding frenzy&amp;rdquo;! The other guy who is supposed to help me out these last 2 days didn&amp;rsquo;t show up until after 12 noon! Ended up taking a cab to the exposition center&amp;hellip; about $20 later and some really crazy talk from the cab driver! Scary stuff as he went off on a dialogue with himself&amp;hellip; Couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get the hell out of the cab!</description>

      <description>The third and last day at the exposition was without a doubt the best day of them all! There were times when I was completely surrounded by people who just wanted to chit-chat&amp;hellip; but there were many chances to just walk around, talk to people, take a few extra pictures and not worry about leaving my helper alone in the booth.Ã‚Â Some of the highlights in my oppinion were:
 The guys from Slashdot were playing XBox 360 all day long using the huge screen they had set up at their lounge area;   They also brought in a freezer filled to the top with ice cream, which quickly vanished as they started distributing it together with other things such as t-shirts; I got to meet Komander Taco, the &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;quot;behind Slashdot;   I got to meet Jon Ã¢â‚¬Å&amp;quot;Mad DogÃ¢â‚¬Â?</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about this for I will be there with my good friend&amp;hellip; Have you ever been to some type of event (it could be softball) that you really enjoy but in the company of someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t really like it and only accompanied you after putting up with weeks of you begging him/her to go with you?</description>

Whoever hasn&amp;rsquo;t watched his old web show Prog8ox doesn&amp;rsquo;t missed out big time!
As Pete wanted to publish something fairly quick and gave us all a very tight schedule (he&amp;rsquo;s a slave driver I tell you), and we went into code release mode at work, I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to write my article about GNU/Linux Appliances and Cloud Computing.</description>

      <description>Life has shifted to high gear these last 2 weeks and my time was mostly spent at work, with my kids, and working on a secret project I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about yet. In the meantime, lots have happened and I just wanted to mention the arrival of my N810 last week! It is shiny! It is cool! It is very useful! I want to thank the Maemo and Nokia guys for this opportunity and hope to deliver some good news about this device soon!</description>

      <description>Reading today&amp;rsquo;s post by Miguel about the 10 years anniversary of Ximian&amp;rsquo;s incorporation brought back memories of a time when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as involved with open source&amp;hellip; a time when I hated my job and would do anything to score a job with a Linux company. I had decided to attend a Microsoft boot camp in Massachusetts and since I was going to be around Boston, for some reason I decided to send Miguel an email asking him if he would mind meeting with me and maybe grabbing a cup of coffee.</description>

Good opportunity to chit-chat and goof off, specially if you happen to sit next to devnet!</description>

In case you missed it, the LXDE project is taking part of this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code! I&amp;rsquo;m also very excited for the invitation to participate for the first time in the capacity of mentor!
&amp;quot;LXDE is an energy saving and extremely fast and performing desktop solution. It works well with computers on the low end of the performance spectrum such as new generation netbooks and other small mobile computers.</description>

      <description>Ever since MeetUp announced they would start charging groups money to use their free service, I started thinking of possible alternatives to keep the Northern NJ Linux Meetup group alive. I understand that everyone is entitled to make a living but I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with their decision of making this drastic change of heart without any warnings. I have spoken to some people and read some posts/comments online and came to the conclusion that the smaller groups will most likely vanish in the turmoil.</description>

      <description>Someone had commented on a previous post about a media player for Windows called Foobar2000. Having just been swept off my feet by Billy, I decided to give it a try. I chose the &amp;ldquo;Special&amp;rdquo; download option and was very impressed with the extensive options for music file formats available. There&amp;rsquo;s also a good amount of modules or plugins that can be downloaded from the web site. The interface is very simple and minimalistic, focusing almost that entirely on the task at hand: just playing your music files.</description>

This is something that happens quite often and it never stops amazing me just how much she loves to read! So even though it was almost 21:00 and I had just walked in from work, we set by the table and started reading some of her books.

      <description>So I have finally migrated BillReminder to Google Code, thanks to the helping hand of a few gents from Google. I did expect a full, smooth migration process but, for better or worse, there are a lot of manual steps that you have to perform before you can have the same structure (well, not the same but something usefull) from SourceForge. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d mention here some of the things I had to do for those who may find themselves wanting to do the same thing.</description>

      <description>Read some nostalgic posts about the now defunt tv show The Screen Savers. It made it sound like it was a great show! PUAH! TSS was an interesting show back in the pre-Sarah-and-Kevin-and-hottie-girls-wearing-mini-skirts era! During the last 2-3 seasons of its existence they completely lost its charm, switching from a simple show that was actually helpfull to the computer illiterate or novice, to a super commercialized show. Almost all of their reviews and segments involved some type of commercial application and some of the new members showed complete ignorance of the material they were supposedly covering.</description>

It was fairly interesting how the problem people were complaning about could be moderated by something like the Ubuntu Code of Conducthttps://launchpad.net/codeofconduct! Great session and Luishttp://tieguy.org/ had a great analogy as for how a community should work like a well thrown party! :)</description>

A while back I wrote about how I first got hooked on coffee and received some really good comments and suggestions for new coffees to try. I was immediately attracted to one coffee in particular: Zoka! Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what it was but there was something about the name that tickled my fancy. So I sent their customer service department an email and asked if they would send me a few samples.</description>

This morning was the last straw for me. I have already signed a contract with dreamhost and will be migrating my two blogs in the next few days.</description>

You probably remember reading about my issues with running my WordPress-based blog on Dreamhost&#39;s environment, and how frustrated I was with the experience of using their Private Server services. The short version is that I eventually migrated my blog back to their shared hosting environment, turned off most of the plugins and cried myself to sleep.
The very next day, after reading (and replying to) the comments I received, one in particular caught my eye: Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Free Usage Tier offering new customers the following EC2 services each month for one year:</description>

The logic I used was as follows:
 All of my current music files were originally encoded from my own, store-bought CDs&amp;hellip; I have pretty much gotten away with keeping the real CDs at home because [lengthy explanation followed here]&amp;hellip; and decided to keep a digitized copy stored in one of my many external hard drives.</description>

After the initial import process by which Musik Cube extracts and populates itself with the information from your media files, I was pleased with the simple and clean UI look.</description>

It turns out that every quarter this application gets modified to satisfy the new &amp;ldquo;business rules&amp;rdquo; that are &amp;ldquo;engineered&amp;rdquo; by the major stakeholders in order to satisfy their needs.</description>

      <description>Today I created a blueprint I intend to promote for Launchpad&#39;s Rosetta workflow. Titled &amp;ldquo;The process by which translation teams can better handle collaboration&amp;quot; (and its matching full specification), it is my intent to describe a mechanism by which translation teams can better administrate the contributions sent by Rosetta users, provide useful feedback and take a first step toward a better relationship with upstream projects.
I kindly invite those interested in the same topic to subscribe to the blueprint and add their feedback to the specification page, specially those who like me have their feet in both upstream and Rosetta worlds.</description>

 After breaking (I&amp;rsquo;m still clueless as for what really happened&amp;hellip; Maybe I zapped it by wearing my fleece sweater) my SanDisk 1GB jump drive within 20 minutes of use last Wednesday, I finally drove back to CompUSA and picked up this little fella. It aboslutely rocks! I&amp;rsquo;ve now installed Portable Firefox 1.0.1 and really like it. Today I want to take the time to sort most of my MP3s and load them in for a fun, music-filled day at work.</description>

I downloaded the setup file and chose my Pegasus as the destination folder. I then chose one of the several music folders I have inside Pegasus and started listening to my songs immediately. The program seems to have been written for those of us who hate using the mouse and rather use keyboard shortcuts.</description>

      <description>The very first thing I do with a new laptop installation of Gnu/Linux is to install Network Manager (sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome). Eventhough I have met people who have claimed to hate it to death, I still consider it to be the best invention since the invention of sliced bread!
However, something very peculiar happens if you install it after you&amp;rsquo;ve already used your laptop to access a.. uhh&amp;hellip; access point: the little Network Manager applet won&amp;rsquo;t detect the wireless device!</description>

      <description>Well, not those kids anyway&amp;hellip; :) I just packaged a couple of new applications today to see if I could augment my Openbox experience. Well, one of them was more out of curiosity. ;)
The first one was Nitrogen, &amp;ldquo;a background browser and setter for X windows.&amp;rdquo; It is fairly light with a very clean interface. Sure I can set my wallpaper via the command line, but the preview thumbnails are very helpful!</description>

I bring to the table my background as a translator for the GNOME team for the last 9-10 months, as well as my background as a translator and former leader of the Brazilian Ubuntu Translation Team (and some minor contributions with the Brazilian KDE Team).
I want to take the opportunity to properly thank Adriano Winter Bess for kindly stepping down as the pt_BR translations maintainer, and allowing me to take this role.</description>

      <description>Some people reported dependency errors when using one of the two .deb packages I announced today. Turns out it was due to python-sqlite2 and python-image&amp;hellip; Our own Luiz Armesto has whipped up a newer package that can be downloaded here, now with all the right dependencies. Thanks to Diogo Autilio and Alex Bevilacqua again for sending me his packages as well (see comments)!
UPDATE: Just as I was about to submit this post, Diogo sent me a newer package with updates up to this second!</description>

Last time I stepped on Brazilian soil I was almost 17 and had barely travelled outside of my (then) home state of Espirito Santo. Now, 14 years later, I came back to re-visit old friends and relatives. Though things have dramatically changed and a great deal of my friends have moved out, I have managed to enjoy my stay so far.</description>

 My pet project BillReminder is now hosted in the GNOME SVN repository! It took me a while to get the right resources and free time to migrate everything, but I believe that it is now completed.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, following the announcement that the folks behind the Opera web browser were giving away registration keys (the FREE part is implied) in celebration of their 10th anniversary, I too took the time to download a Linux version to see what the big deal was.
Opera is yet another web browser that is freely available for several different operating systems (Linux and Windows included) with a small caviat: The un-registered version has a toolbar-like banner displaying adds while you browse.</description>

Though I was very busy at work, I managed to file a couple of issues with several of them being resolved by Luiz before the end of the day! I had some positive feedback from people who tried the Mandriva package and even a *.deb too. Hope to fix some other pending issues over the weekend.</description>

Year after year the event took on a more business-like approach, and colorfull couches and hang out areas were slowly converted to formal meeting lounges and the geeks were no longer the majority in attendance.</description>

He was kind enough to accept my invitation to visit and tell us about his work with Ubuntu and Debian Linux. I think everyone had a good time! Mako seems to be a really nice guy and was more than willing to answer our questions.</description>

      <description>Been kind of stormy down here in North Carolina since last night, with some pretty serious thunder storms causing havok around the area. Woke up today to see some trees snapped in half and a car buried under some big branches. With the electricity flickering all the time I thought it would be safe to turn off the PC and wait it out. After yet another stormy period today, I think it is safe to surf the web now.</description>

After several weeks agonizing over how to afford a trip to attend GUADEC 2010, I have finally arrived at the conclusion that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to make it. Due to my current financial situation and obligations as a father of two, it would be unrealistic to hop on a plane and go to this event right now for me. Unfortunately none of the organizations I approached were able to offer me any type of financial support, understandable due to today&amp;rsquo;s economy issues.</description>

About 2 weeks ago I was informed my project had gotten canceled and with it, my position.</description>

      <description>While I was busy at work, Openbox 3.4.5 was released! As always, I&amp;rsquo;ve packaged it for Foresight Linux (the 2-devel branch) and you can get it using conary or PackageKit.

I also took the time last night to pimp PyPanel with a few patches and bump Nitrogen to 1.2 (not shown in the screenshot).
Speaking of Nitrogen, I looked around for an easy and straight forward way to change the desktop wallpaper in a non-GNOME environment and was amazed at how GNOME-centric they all were.</description>

      <description>Reading Scott James Remnant&amp;rsquo;s latest post on what he calls &amp;ldquo;Parallel Peer Programming&amp;rdquo; got me wondering if the same approach could work for the small project I&amp;rsquo;ve been secretly working on.
Scott fired up 3 separate screem sessions to which his co-worker Gustavo Niemeyer synced to. From that point one, they could see what each other was doing &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; in their respective terminals/laptops. Scott would write test cases in one terminal (to which Gustavo could now &amp;ldquo;watch&amp;rdquo;), Gustavo would then write the code in the second terminal to make sure it would pass the test, and use the third terminal to test it.</description>

I was the &amp;ldquo;priest&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;couple&amp;rdquo; to the left were the &amp;ldquo;godparents.&amp;rdquo; We had lots of real food and drinks&amp;hellip; everything decorated too!!!
Man, how great were those days! Not a single worry on my mind and lots of playing time!</description>

The entire IT team attended the hour long meeting where the CIO very eloquently explained his plan for the entire IT organization (which is actually made up of several smaller IT groups throughout the Board of Education). In the end he &amp;ldquo;opened up the floor&amp;rdquo; for questions and/or comments. For a grueling 10 seconds nobody uttered a word.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; and today, chatting online with André Noel, I remembered that I was at Linux World Expo in Boston, MA representing Ubuntu! I had my &amp;ldquo;15 seconds of fame&amp;rdquo; when I was interviewed by the guys from Lulu.tv.
Those were 3 great days that I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know how your work environment is, but where I work all the engineers spend their entire days with their headphones glued to their heads listening to music. Each one of us must own a couple of thousands music files (all legal copies, I can assure you) in our laptops, and since we all share our collections through the office, one could say that we have a pretty decent online selection of music for all genres and tastes.</description>

      <description>It has been a long time since I last blogged on my other web site Linux Gnubbie. It was my first real &amp;ldquo;taste&amp;rdquo; of a real blown web site and up to the day I bought the domain I had relied on public (e.g. chock-full of banners and adds), free web site providers. Those really sucked specially because you were pretty much at the mercy of their regulations and forget about getting some type of remote access to work on your files.</description>

      <description>I completely forgot to mention about this last Thursday&amp;rsquo;s first Open Source Alliance meeting at Paramus&#39; Panera Bread. I arrived earlier than everybody else despite the really bad traffic on Route 4 West. The place was really crowded and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set up my laptop at the &amp;ldquo;usual&amp;rdquo; place by the conference room. I ended up going to the couch by the front entrance. Armed with a hot cup of coffee I proceeded to get boot my laptop and get some internet going&amp;hellip; About 15 minutes later I realized something fishy was going on with the free wifi for I just could not get a working IP assigned.</description>

      <description>I meant to post this early this weekend but had too many things happening simultaneously and didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance. I&amp;rsquo;m an avid reader of several Open Source blogging &amp;ldquo;planets&amp;rdquo; and religiously read them every day in order to keep up with new developments or just to pick up a few things here and there. I&amp;rsquo;d say that most of the time I really enjoy the posts that get published but every now and then come across a few posts which I find inclined to post a reply.</description>

      <description>I was extremely pleased/amazed when I read the change log with the modifications, new features, and bugs fixed in the up and coming new version for Openbox! The list is too big to mention here, but take my word for it: it is amazing!
You can already get packages for Ubuntu Feisty, Debian, Arch Linux, and Slackware. If you&amp;rsquo;re running Foresight Linux and want to try (unofficial for now) it, drop me a line.</description>

      <description>It is finally here!!! Openbox 3.4 was just released, together with a fresh version of ObConf 2.0!!! I believe this is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve avidly followed the development and release of an application, and I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of the work the entire Openbox Crew has put together! Read the official announcement here.

Packages and source code can be found here. If you&amp;rsquo;re running Foresight Linux, you can get the new versions by running:</description>

      <description>As the title says, Openbox 3.4.2 and ObConf 2.0.1 were just released. Due to some confusion from some people I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to, this new version is not yet available for Ubuntu or Debian via the repositories (i.e. apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic).
For those running Ubuntu Feisty or Debian Etch, download the .deb files from the downloads page. You&amp;rsquo;ll also find packages for Slackware and Arch Linux. If you are however running Foresight Linux:</description>

      <description>Finally caught up with my rss feeds and found out about some new sexyness coming up in Openbox. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to get Openbox(git) and Obconf(git) from their respective git repositories as well as this theme.

If you&amp;rsquo;re running Foresight and want to try this (since it is still in development, I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to submit it to a repo yet), let me know and I&amp;rsquo;ll get you the changeset.</description>

      <description>PackageKit is DBUS packaging abstraction layer that makes use of a cross-distro, cross-architecture API to manage your system&amp;rsquo;s packages. In other words, it is a way for updating and administering software on a GNU/Linux system without worrying about the distro or underlying package management system.
Having gone from concept to release in inly 6 weeks of intensive collaborative work, version 0.1.0 already sports backends for conary, yum, apt, box, and alpm as well as comprehensive documentation and some translations (Vladimir Melo and I managed to get the Brazilian Portuguese translation done just in time!</description>

      <description>For a while Foresight Linux users had no graphical interface for managing their systems packages and/or updates, mainly because the development for the conary backend fell out of scope and our radar (this is a nicer way to say that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have someone to maintain it). But thanks to the work of zodman, jesse and others PackageKit is making its way back to our desktop.

      <description>Complying with my decision to learn how to package software for Debian-based distros, I spent some (unfortunately very little) time this weekend going over this tutorial on packaging for Debian. Almost everything worked as per the instructions, minus some minor changes I had to perform in order to end up with a working .deb file. The experience was very rewarding and I have already started to plan more &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; practice trials to get the hang of it!</description>

      <description>Today I received a mysterious package in the mail. Turns out it was some swag from Pandora: a hat and some stickers.

You know what the best part was? Not the cool hat or stickers, but the letter that accompanied the items in the envelope. It was actually manually signed (i.e. not a print out) by Lucia Willow, Community Manager, and Tim Westergren, Founder. It is the kind of attention to details that makes a huge difference!</description>

Netapplet allows me to store multiple settings for different wifi access points for easy switching while on the road. Very usefull and easy to do! Gnome-blog is supposed to allow you to write a post to your blog without accessing the web interface. I say &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m yet to try it.</description>

It pretty much supports all the major blog protocols out there and it has a neat interface. Since I use my Portable Firefox 1.5 a lot, this little gem works just perfect for me on the go!</description>

I had to take Wednesday off from work so I could bring her to her doctor but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. He even performed an on-site strep throat test to see if that was the problem but the results were inconclusive.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s Picasa software came to mind and I quickly downloaded it on my laptop. I misy tell you that I&amp;rsquo;m very impressed with user interface. Not as much with the features (which by the way are just enough for your daily crop-resize-remove red eye needs) but the looks of it!</description>

For those who follow my many different projects and enterprises, you probably already know that I have been hosting a podcast called Castálio Podcast, a bi-weekly show where I interview people from the Brazilian FOSS world and talk about their likes, dislikes and what events and factors shaped their lives!
When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an episode in English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an overwhelming &amp;lsquo;Yes!</description>

      <description>Just finished packaging poEdit and the translate-toolkit for Foresight. I usually do my translations using Vim, but ultimately use these two tools to &amp;ldquo;fine tune&amp;rdquo; them before submiting them to bugzilla.
Speaking of translations, I cannot wait to see the new GNOME with 100% desktop translations in portuguese (Brazilian), thanks to a partnership between the Brazilian GNOME and Ubuntu translation teams! ;)</description>

      <description>Been really enjoying my SeaGate Portable Drive. I managed to upload all my 13 GB+ of MP3s and Oggs together with a bunch of usefull applications and code I was carrying with me on a couple of CDs for quite some time. Having a central and portable repository for all of my music, documents, and code is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted for the longest time. I have also started to use the portable version of Firefox, which contrary to the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; version runs off of a portable device and not a (non-portable) hard drive.</description>

      <description>For all you crazy USB-Portable-Device-Lovers out there: Portable FireFox 1.0.2 has been released!!! My favorite new features are:
 COMMANDLINE PASSING - The Portable Firefox launcher now supports commandline passing! That&amp;rsquo;s right, you can drag an HTML file onto PortableFirefox.exe and drop it and it will open it right up. You can even manually set PortableFirefox.exe to be your default browser in Windows and it will open up URLs correctly. It will only pass in one commandline parameter and it is expecting it to be a URL.</description>

      <description>I meant to write this before but got really busy this past week. About 2 weeks ago I sent my oldest daughter Yv to spend her Spring break with my parents in New York. It was the very first time she went anywhere without my wife or me, and we were all very nervous about the whole thing.

I worked from home that day so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to drive back from work and then to the airport.</description>

To be honest, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very thrilled about the idea but since I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had a choice, I prepared myself to spend some long, boring hours at the &amp;ldquo;class room.&amp;rdquo; Well, it turns out that besides learning to use a project management tool called Primavera, we are also learning what it takes to professionaly managed a project (from the IT perspective).</description>

      <description>Continuing with my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution of working harder at the translation and bug triage of Ubuntu Linux, I have finally removed Windows XP from one of my PCs (the only one then running something other than Linux) and installed Dapper Drake. &amp;hellip;and as the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;a picture is worth 1,000 words,&amp;rdquo; you can see below how I have prioritized Ubuntu in my professional life:
 Ubuntu Dapper (x86) running on a Pentium 4 (lower left side); Ubuntu Breezy (x86_64) running on an AMD 64 (lower right side); Ubuntu Breezy (x86) running on my Laptop (IBM X40) (table top to the left); Coffee mug (the biggie size me version) with Ubuntu logo (Thanks Toadman!</description>

      <description>Been using PulseAudio for several months now and was extremelly happy with the end result. The ability of controlling the volume for specific applications alone made it very worth the change. But there was one little issue that bothered me a lot: not being able to play my games with support for audio! Back when I started searching for a solution, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that would resolve this issue and I eventually accepted that as a fact.</description>

      <description>Been working on a pet project to help out with theÂ GNOME translations (as well as have a chance to learn more about Django) and the end product is now available at www.pylyglot.org. Basically, it is a database of all strings from all available GNOME packages parsed to (hopefully) help open source translators with their effort by providing suggestions based on existing translations.
But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more! Since the entire collection of GNOME packages is available for your perusal, you can check how a certain word was translated across all packages and use this information to standardize the translation for the entire project.</description>

What a difference a day makes! Thanks to some feedback I got both here and in private, and thanks to a contributor with some extra free cycles at hand, Pylyglot got anotherÂ face liftÂ today.
So what&amp;rsquo;s new? There are now 245 total packages and 3,165,335 translations from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s 61 packages and 954,884 translations! You can also now link to a query using the resulting url from your searches using the format language=FOO&amp;amp;query=BAR, where FOO is the language&amp;rsquo;s ISO code and BAR is the term you&amp;rsquo;re searching.</description>

Kind of ironic how my post titled &amp;ldquo;Stop whining and improve your life&amp;quot; attracted so much negativity in the comments area. It became very clear to me, however, that most were just too eager to make assumptions about my intention or probably wanted to vent a bit. Those who know me personally or have followed my blog for a while know that I don&amp;rsquo;t live in a fantasy world (though sometimes Chapel Hill can feel that way) filled with unicorn and cotton candy clouds.</description>

      <description>It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Radio Tray 0.5.1! I have been following the development of this tiny streaming media player from the very start and even cloned it so that I could play with it on BitBucket. After a while I approached the developer, Carlos Ribeiro, and asked him to take a look and all of the stuff I had done. I also suggested that he starts using Mercurial instead of Subversion to make easier for people to clone the code and submit patches in the near future.</description>

      <description>The need to be thin!
I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo; when it comes to how I listen to music in general, and most of the time I&amp;rsquo;ll use whatever media player is installed by default with my distribution. Only recently I started actively tagging and editing metadata about the songs I own, so you could safely say that if I can listen to music while I work, I&amp;rsquo;m a happy camper!</description>

      <description>On his latest post titled &amp;ldquo;Foresight Linux is dead?&amp;rdquo;, Thilo Pfennigs rightly asks the question that many of the current Foresight Linux users may be asking themselves. With the current stable release dated as of May 2009 and no explicit roadmap stating when the next release will be published, is it really safe to say that Foresight Linux is indeed dead?
In order to properly answer this question, one must first take a look at what the year of 2009 reserved for this young distribution.</description>

What follows was my reply to this person. I hope it will prove to be useful to any other team out there who may be struggling with the same issues. I&amp;rsquo;m also interested to learn how other teams managed to keep their members involved and/or how others can benefit from their experience.</description>

      <description>With the release of Ubuntu Dapper, many were the new users who initiated the linux world without any knowledge of how to configure their systems for a complete nirvana experience. Sure the default instalation takes care of supplying the majority of tools and applications a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; home user would need &amp;ldquo;out of the box&amp;rdquo;, but there are certain technologies which, due to some licensing issues (mostly related to distribution, etc), are not installed automatically.</description>

I used to feel that the entire organization was plotting against me and wondered if it was just me. But now, I have definite confirmation that my sanity is still somewhat intact! My new co-worker (and I think she was also hired to be my supervisor) has been experiencing all the abuse herself for a few weeks now and seems to be in the brink of walking out of here!</description>

      <description>I spent a good chunk of my evening trying to implement the automatic registration of a gconf schema file via a setup.py and&amp;hellip; got nowhere. Seems that most people who wanted to do the same ended up running gconftool-2 directly as such:
 GCONF_CONFIG_SOURCE=`gconftool-2 &amp;mdash;get-default-source` gconftool-2 &amp;mdash;makefile-install-rule /etc/gconf/schemas/*.schemas
 Has anyone got any advice (patches wouldÂ be awesome) to go with my code?</description>

I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I forgot to blog about one of the biggest act of cowardice in human history: This past Saturday, August 6th 2005 marked 60 years since the US dropped an atomic bomb (codenamed Little Boy) over Hiroshima! In a matter of seconds, complete generations were literally wiped off the face of the Earth and the Empire of Japan brought down to their knees had no other choice but surrender during WWII.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Django 1.2 E-Commerce&amp;quot;Â starts with a very ambitious goal: design, develop and deploy a functional ecommerce web site for the fictional CranStore.com company. Sounds great, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
I started flipping through the usual introductory pages explaining what Django is and why use it for a project like this. It was all fairly brief which already led me to believe that knowledge of Django&amp;rsquo;s inner works and basic setup and configuration was required to follow along.</description>

      <description>I just had to get this off my chest! I have read a few &amp;ldquo;reviews&amp;rdquo; for The Hitchhiker&amp;rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy and am very annoyed by what everyone is saying. I&amp;rsquo;d say that 5% of these so called reviews say that nobody should see it due to its deviations from the original book, how they Hollywood-ed the plot by adding a romance, yadda, yadda&amp;hellip; And I kept thinking: &amp;ldquo;So what the movie is not a transcription from book?</description>

      <description>For anyone who has read my previous post and know me&amp;hellip; or know and read my blog, I&amp;rsquo;d like to ask for a personal favor. Every day I see people taking the time to submit news bits to sites like Digg, Slashdot, etc, about several different topics, varying from how to do stuff on your computer to the daily Hollywood gossip. What I ask is the following:
Write something, no matter how big or small, about what I wrote on my previous post about this video.</description>

      <description>Danilo Å egan, lead developer for the Rosetta translation tool sent an email to the Ubuntu translators list yesterday with some great news related to the policy of how upstream translations are managed:
 Launchpad Translations has changed the translation precedence policy with the December release: now upstream (&amp;ldquo;packaged&amp;rdquo;) translations will be given more priority in specific cases. Yet, Launchpad Translations keeps the ability to override any specific upstream translation if so is desired.</description>

      <description>Been spending some time using the RSS.NET library (&amp;quot;RSS.NET is an open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds. It provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds. It is fully compatible with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1, implementing all constructs.&amp;quot; and decided to create my own Rss reader. It still has a long way to go but it is in a semi-usefull state. I know there&amp;rsquo;s a million rss readers out there but if anyone is interested in working on this with me just drop me a line.</description>

This post has been sitting in my Drafts folder for a while now, as I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure when the right time would be to publish it. It is basically my personal reflection on the last 5 years I have worked doing translations for free and open source software (FOSS) and a few lessons I learned along the way. It is also a rant against those who took my labor for granted.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lazy when it comes to writing and hate when I cannot do something by using the keyboard only. Or when I have to type the same thing over and over. That is why I chose to use this plugin. Dynamic Text Replace &amp;ldquo;allows you to easily pre-define text replacement template strings and allow for text to be passed in.</description>

      <description>On his latest post about Linux usability, St. Hermann replies to Andres Solomon&amp;rsquo;s comment about the typical Linux developer&amp;rsquo;s mentality and how users choose their favorite distros.
It has been shown (through blogs, mailing lists, etc) before that the typical Linux developer (here I&amp;rsquo;m mostly refering to application developers/maintainers) will often feel irritated if someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow the proper protocols for giving him feedback&amp;hellip; Let me say this again so not to leave any doubts: Some user finds some application/code appealing to their need and wants to provide the author/maintainer some feedback, in order to improve said application/code&amp;hellip; and the author/maintainer gets offended by it!</description>

Having used a few other tools to automate web application testing/QA, I felt that it was time to revisit Selenium and see if there was anything new worth checking.
I must say that the combination of Selenium and Sauce make up for a killer toolset for anyone who has to deal with supporting a web application across multiple platforms and browsers!</description>

Over the weekend I came across an interesting article in the New York Times called &amp;ldquo;Plan B: Skip College&amp;rdquo;. According to the Department of Education, &amp;ldquo;no more than half of those who began a four-year bachelorâ€™s degree program in the fall of 2006 will get that degree within six years.&amp;rdquo; Even more shocking, &amp;ldquo;fï»¿ï»¿or college students who ranked among the bottom quarter of their high school classes, the numbers are even more stark: 80 percent will probably never get a bachelorâ€™s degree or even a two-year associateâ€™s degree!</description>

The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Thomas Haden Church (Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous adventures.</description>

      <description>So yesterday I found out that Sun will (finally) get on the Open Source wagon&amp;hellip;Ã‚Â I&amp;rsquo;ll refrain from commenting on why I think they (Sun) have made this choice&amp;hellip;Ã‚Â What I really want to know is:Ã‚Â When will Madobe (Macromedia+Adobe) wake up and smell the coffee???</description>

      <title>Simplifying gtk.TreeView?</title>

      <description>One of these days I was working on a new graphical interface for a new application in python, when I noticed something familiar. Every time I need to add a gtk.TreeView widget to one of my programs, I end up re-writing the same code, over and over again and again&amp;hellip; so I thought:
&amp;quot;Why not create my own kit/widget and stop rehashing code?&amp;quot;
Since I had a pretty uneventfull Saturday, I ended up creating GenericList, my own abstraction of a generic grk.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my 6th wedding anniversary&amp;hellip; Elizabeth and I lived together for almost 2 years first&amp;hellip; to get to know each other&amp;hellip; to experience what married life would be like before actually doing it. After only 3 months I just knew she was the one and I was destined to spend the rest of my life with her&amp;hellip; grow old with her&amp;hellip; The problem was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make enough to support the both of us&amp;hellip; so we lived together, sharing a 3 bedroom apartment with some folks&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I have just watched this video about the never ending conflict between Brazilian indigenous natives and the white farmers from small town Brazil. This is the kind of stuff that is well known by the entire country, but avoided by most for fear of retaliation!
Like pretty much anywhere in the Americas, the Brazilian indigenous population was almost completely massacred and enslaved by the the white settlers during the colonial times.</description>

This was taken last Sunday at the North Carolina Botanical Garden in the best place to live in the world, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it as my computer&amp;rsquo;s desktop wallpaper.</description>

      <description>I often find myself creating a new .NET project every time I want to try some simple piece of code, which is not only overkill sometimes but also counter productive if you need to sift thorugh the different folders for an specific piece of code&amp;hellip; Even when you find it you end up having to create yet another project to test it out. While discussing with a friend about a very annoying Xml Serialization error I was getting at work, I was pointed to Snippet Compiler and a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders!</description>

I not a big fan of the white stuff since it used to mean cleaning up the car, drive to the slush, and get all wet. But my girls loved it, specially Yv who seized the opportunity to make snow angels.

It was also Kate&#39;s first snow and eventhough she&#39;s been coffing lately, we decided to bring her outside (wearing a heavy coat) to play for a while.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;d think that at least Google would have considered the open source community. This really blows but I&amp;rsquo;ll survive.</description>

      <description>I wanted to write about the concept of selling open source ideas and what are some of the required criteria for being successful in doing it for quite some time, and Stormy&#39;s comment on my last post sort of pushed me to it.
I use the word &amp;ldquo;sell&amp;rdquo; here not strictly in the sense of a financial transaction but also in the sense of getting your open source product to be adopted and have a better chance at standing out from the huge pool of available open source software.</description>

Originally uploaded by omaciel.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t received any offers of help with my RssReader.NET application&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I was expecting offers anyhow. :) Yesterday and today I spent some time making some changes to the UI as well adding some new functionality. UI changes include:
 Removed ComboBox control - Users will have to add new feeds via an interface. Switched ListView control for a TreeView control - Will allow for expansion/collapsing of feeds and increase visibility of available posts.</description>

It talks among several things about loving what you do&amp;hellip; About being able to look back on your life and &amp;ldquo;connect the dots&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; To make every day of your life count!!! Needless to say I completely agree with what he said and am desperately looking for a way to follow what my heart urges me to do!</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; or, how I finally got off my butt and became more involved with the open source community.
It was not long ago, during one of my recent rants about open source not always being open to non-contributors, that I first heard of Stephan Hermann. He had written something that really clicked with my way of thinking, and shortly after exchanging some emails/posts replies I was convinced that it was about time I got more involved with the community.</description>

      <description>I came across Global Pandora after checking out the anonymous tip left on my previous post. Apparently it is a site that explains how you can gain access to the services provided by Pandora in case you live outside the United States. I was not aware of this, but due to some legal mambo jambo, Pandora is only available in the US, which is a shame!
Since I do live in the United States, I didn&amp;rsquo;t try out the tip, but took the time to check out some of the other music sites listed on Global Pandora.</description>

      <description>During your day to day conversation with your friends and family members, do you find yourself talking about work or life in general in a negative manner? Do you tell others that something or someone is preventing you from moving ahead and fulfilling your dreams? Do you tend to hang out with people who share your (negative) opinion about work and life? Can you keep a conversation with anyone without eventually dragging your audience into the &amp;ldquo;painful state&amp;rdquo; that your life is?</description>

      <description>This 3-day weekend (it was the Independence Day here in the US this Friday) turned out to be a 3-day stay indoors weekend for us. Due to a hurricane (don&amp;rsquo;t remember the name now) that is fast approaching the East coast, we were rocked by severe thunderstorms every single night.

We had planned to watch the new Indiana Jones movie at the outdoor movie night in Southern Village but managed to get inside the car right before the wind kicked in and the sky was lit with lightning.</description>

From now on, www.ogmaciel.com will no longer be my blog written in English, but instead will serve as a &amp;ldquo;business card/window&amp;rdquo; into my world.

Titled &amp;ldquo;Enhance Damned Lies and integrate it with open-tran.eu&amp;rdquo;, it basically tries to lure someone with time to add a little bit of pizzaz to a site that I regularly use in order to proceed with my translations. Now, no offense intended but how can something like &amp;ldquo;Individual Workspace Wallpapers&amp;quot; be considered as &amp;quot;Rockstar Ideas&amp;quot; compared to the benefits of improving the work flow of those who deliver a GNOME Desktop completely translated every single release cycle?</description>

Though I&amp;rsquo;m not too much into tv shows and only selectively watch a few shows (Scrubs, Seinfeld and Frasier re-runs, Futurama, Whose Line Is It?

I have filled out the web form to register a new project on Google Code, but since this project already exists in SourceForge, I have to go through an extra step where a message should be sent to the project lead (which happens to be me) requesting approval for this migration. The problem is that I always get a 500 page when I click on the submit button!</description>

      <description>In an attempt to integrate BillReminder to the GNOME clock, I set out to learn about the evolution-python lib. After messing around for a bit, it became obvious to me that every event added to the generic .evolution/tasks/local/system/calendar.ics file gets automatically synched with GNOME clock. The thing is, I want to create my own separate calendar file, so to not get it mixed with the generic one. The code below does just that, but&amp;hellip; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show up in GNOME clock!</description>

There were many interesting things during our first ever &amp;ldquo;show &amp;amp; tell&amp;rdquo; session, which shall get mentioned on a later post, but all I really wanted to do was to install Ubuntu onto the TabletPC and try to get everything working.
The new and extremelly easy to follow 5-step installation process was readly approved by all, and in approximately 15 minutes I had a complete system, minus support for the stylus pen&amp;hellip; yet.</description>

I have installedÃ‚Â Nvidia&amp;rsquo;s driver and everything is just peachy&amp;hellip; haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to rotate the display yet though.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I managed to package GCompris 8.3 BETA 3-2 and successfuly run it at home. Packaging it was a bit tricky due to a couple of bugs I encountered along the way, but luckly bdoin was around #gcompris to confirm/deny my assumptions.

The main reason for me doing this was so that Yv, my oldest, could spend some time in front of the computer doing something educational. I was extremelly surprised with the amount of different games available and the very broad range of levels included.</description>

      <description>This last Friday was the second day of my trip to Boston. The agenda was very simple and yet had all the ingredients to an unforgetable day. Having swapped a few emails with Miguel De Icaza where I convinced him to meet me and give me a tour of Ximian&amp;rsquo;s office in Cambridge, we had finally settled I&amp;rsquo;d meet him during his lunch break. My friend Vinny and I left his house around 11am figuring it would take us about 30-40 minutes to get there but we were not counting on getting lost on the way.</description>

Texto Livre is a support group with the objective of offering linguistic support for the documentation of open source software, as well as introduce university-level students to to open source as a tool for research</description>

For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know who he is, suffice to say that he had been a very active member of the GNOME Brazilian translation team for some time now! It is weird for me to refer to him in the past tense&amp;hellip;
The news came to me via an email that was sent to the Brazilian mailing list just a few minutes ago by a close friend of the family.</description>

Just as Dennis Kucinich would have been my candidate of choice for the democrats, I must say that Ron Paul has left a very good impression in me. While the other candidates (and even the panel moderators) busied themselves by ridiculing him, he gave answers!</description>

      <description>During one of those lucid moments of spontaneous philosophical discussions I have with my wife while driving to work, I came up with the following question:
Assuming you follow Christianity&amp;rsquo;s point of view about the creation of the world and human kind, you most likely know that God gave life to Adam and Eve, Earth&amp;rsquo;s first inhabitants. They proceeded to follow his advice of propagating the race and gave birth to 3 kids (I believe they were all of masculine gender).</description>

Tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled to give a live demo to the rest of the group! I&amp;rsquo;m ready to blow them off their socks! For such a simple and small program, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve done a pretty good job at making it usefull and stable!</description>

This past March I started a new routine to my Sunday mornings: shortly after breakfast with the kids, I flip my laptop open and start reading the Books section of the NY Times online. I wanted to get the real deal, dead tree &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; of it for quite some time, but at USD$6 just for the Sunday paper I figured that reading it online would have to do it.</description>

      <description>I wanted to comment on Tristan Rhodes&#39;s latest post before but didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance. Last time I checked he had received 56 comments on his suggestion to &amp;ldquo;unify&amp;rdquo; the Ubuntu name (and by unify he means to avoid the proliferation of several different distribution versions, that distinguish themselves based only on the window manager installed by default).
I must tell you that I have to agree with him, mainly because I feel that the many [U|X|Ku|n]buntu out there could be very confusing to an end user who&amp;rsquo;s decided to check out GNU/Linux for the first time.</description>

      <description>My last post brought in a few interesting replies, the great majority of them showing support (somewhat) to the idea of unifying the Ubuntu name. While I let the caffeine surge do the talking toward the end of the post, I should have added the following statement to completely close my argument:
I&amp;rsquo;m not suggesting that we stop manufacturing/shipping/distributing the other &amp;ldquo;flavors&amp;rdquo; of Ubuntu in the form of CDs and downloads.</description>

      <description>Imagine yourself off on a bus going on a business trip at some far away place. This being a far away place, you eventually fall into a very heavy sleep and loose track of time and direction. Several hours later (or maybe even days?) you are awaken by someone who, speaking a different dialect seems to be telling you that the bus has reached its destination. Still a bit groggy from the sleep you shrug off this incident, grab your bag and step out of the bus and&amp;hellip; To your surprise, you realize that the bus station seems somewhat odd and different from what you had expected&amp;hellip; and when paying closer attention you also notice that every thing, people, stores signs, even trees, look different.</description>

      <description>I started today using the new GNOME Display Manager, aka GDM. This new version (under development) was initially written before the GNOME 2.22 release but never made it on time for that release.
Some of new features are:
 Better fast-user-switching support (bug #343539 etc) Enable a smarter people chooser in the greeter Better ConsoleKit integration (seat awareness, coordination etc) Facilitate creating a new blingier greeter Dynamically configure displays Allow session agents to run in the greeter session (gnome-power-manager etc) Have the ability to only run a single greeter per seat (currently gdmflexiserver will start any number of them) Use PolicyKit for reboot etc authorization/handling Use a better configuration mechanism that is more compatible with a hypothetical systemwide D-Bus based GConf Provide a D-Bus API so that agents like fast-user-switch applet can be written more easily and operate more efficiently Fix all the horrible non-reentrant POSIX signal handling and various race conditions in the current code (bug #336549 etc) Make it easier to do &amp;ldquo;hot desking&amp;rdquo; type things Use a more modern design to simplify maintence and enhance flexibility (use of GObject etc) Use a more robust, secure, and flexible IPC  &amp;hellip; and many more.</description>

      <description>Been spending some quality hacking time these last few days, basically re-writting my tentative Rss reader application. The first 2 iterations relied on the Rss.NET code library but after hitting some major obstacles I sort of &amp;ldquo;left it by the side of the road&amp;rdquo; while I re-grouped my ideas. Last week I finally gathered enough ideas to go back to &amp;ldquo;production.&amp;rdquo; I decided to hack away at the Rss.NET library and turn it into a smaller, lean, and meaner piece of code.</description>

      <description>When I started my GNOME trip, we were on mile 2.16 and the GNOME Brazil crew was in the process of tackling a 26% deficit with the translation process. Together with the Brazilian Ubuntu translation team, we plowed through bugzilla, leaving no empty (or fuzzy) string left to tell stories, and reaching mile 2.18 at 100% translated! :)
Several months later and the road trip continued, with new pieces added to the puzzle, and some great effort by our committers down the stretch.</description>

 I was ecstatic!!! Having had the opportunity to attend GUADEC 2009 at Las Palmas, Gran Canary last year,Â I was thrilled with the possibility of attending my second one and presenting my ideas on how to facilitate the collaboration between downstream and GNOME.</description>

Spent the entire day trying to get some rest but was too restless to fall asleep. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many times I checked my email or browsed my rss feeds! Out of the many tabs I opened and closed in my browser, one remained open at all times: a link to a book called Essential SQLAlchemy!</description>

Spent a good chunk of my free time reading all 9 (out of 10) parts of Lovelace and Babbage Vs The Organist this weekend! I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin to describe how incredibly awesome this comic is! The graphics, the clever writing and jokes, even the sometimes absurd plot twists all combine for delivering a fantastic, fun reading experience!</description>

      <description>My daughter Yv had submitted a drawing about a month ago to a contest sponsored by a local magazine called Carolina Parent. The contest, &amp;ldquo;TV-Turnoff Week&amp;rdquo;, urged kids to unplug from their televisions and spend some more time outdoors!

Yesterday my wife showed me the drawings that were selected, and unfortunately Yv&amp;rsquo;s was not among them. With tearful eyes, I was able to follow the avalanche of emotions going through her mind&amp;hellip; Obviously, frustration and disappointment are not new emotions to me, but seeing it happening to someone still so innocent and unexperienced made me think really hard.</description>

      <description>Dom Lachowicz&#39;s post about this morning&#39;s London terrorism acts touched upon a very delicate subject: how other countries perceive the United States. I agree with almost every one of his sacarsm-filled bulletted reasons why &amp;ldquo;they&amp;rdquo; hate &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; but in the end I think his emotions got the best of him:
 &amp;quot;Try walking a mile in their shoes. If I were in a Saudi&amp;rsquo;s shoes, I might want to blow shit up.</description>

      <description>I took advantage of an unexpected break I had over the weekend to create my own application to change the theme for OpenBox. Sure, I know there&amp;rsquo;s OBConf, but I wanted to write my own in python.
Without further ado, I present version 0.1 of Thematographer for OpenBox!

Even with the dependency on Glade, I find it to be very light and it will detect default themes installed, as well as themes installed on $HOME/.</description>

Had a blast visiting my sister together with my wife and daughter. My older sister and uncle also tagged along to supposedly help out with the driving. Went to sleep at 1am on Thursday and got up at 4am!!! Managed to get there by 3pm and was completely overwhelmed by a feeling of peace.</description>

      <description>Jakub Steiner from Planet Gnome mentioned an old article written by Joel Spolsky on the importance of writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time to absorb his &amp;ldquo;pearls of wisdom.&amp;rdquo; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re a programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure all your snacks are within reach so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to miss your favorite soap.</description>

      <description>For the third time in my life I got a traffic ticket this past Friday. Now, I know I was wrong and parked under a sign that clearly stated no one was allowed to park on that side of the street until 6pm (it was 5:30pm when I pulled up to pick up my daughter from school). But $60 for parking on an empty side street, without blocking any garages, fire hydrants, or important land mark?</description>

Every now and then someone questions the validity of one of my chosen topics, claiming that it should be published on Planet X (my blog is syndicated on quite a few planets) because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk about technology. I understand that someone people may not enjoy reading every single topic that may be published (not only by me), for I am one of them&amp;hellip; honest!</description>

      <description>Your brain: 60% interpersonal, 60% visual, 100% verbal, and 180% mathematical!
Congratulations on being 400% smart! Actually, on my test, everyone is. The above score breaks down what kind of thinking you most enjoy doing. A score above 100% means you use that kind of thinking more than average, and a score below 100% means you use it less. It says nothing about how good you are at any one, just how interested you are in each, relatively.</description>

      <title>Top 10 Reasons for Wearing a Kilt</title>

      <guid>https://omaciel.github.io/posts/top-10-reasons-for-wearing-a-kilt-/</guid>
      <description>Because through out history, men have worn un-bifurcated garments.
Because if women had an appendage hanging between their legs we guarantee you they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be wearing pants.
Freedom, and increased mobility.
You only go around once, so why shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you be as comfortable as possible.
All men deserve air conditioning in the summer. You will chafe no more.
No more adjust, right side, left sideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Say goodbye to wedgies.
A word about the pockets: Unlike pants, the UtilikiltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pockets are only sewn down on top, so that they move with the garment but not with your leg.</description>

So for the last 10 weeks we have been taking all the necessary steps to prepare our daughters, our house and our work schedules to welcome another child into our family.</description>

There are just too many cool features to mention here&amp;hellip; so I won&amp;rsquo;t! Just go ahead and read the release notes instead.
 
From Transifex v8.0 featutes As far as the appliance goes, the most important thing to know is that I dropped MySQL and replaced it with Postgresql, so if you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of updating an existing deployment, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to backup your data and handle the restoration process.</description>

Have you ever wandered if your translations conform to the standard vocabulary that your team uses? Have you ever wanted someone to take a look at what you&amp;rsquo;ve done before sending in your final work for commit approval?
 
From Transifex v8.0 featutes Now, mind you this is still very alpha code but that is probably a good thing since you can play with it and give your feedback on how to improve it.</description>

A quick email to our distribution BrazilianLoCo list with promises of eternal gratitude from $DEITY was able to attract a few replies and by Tuesday (or was it Monday???) night I met up with a few people at #ubuntu-br (Freenode) who were willing to spend some time doing the job.</description>

      <description>Whenever we work on the Brazilian Portuguese translations for Ubuntu Linux through the Rosetta system, we come across some strings that are pretty straight forward to translate, such as &amp;ldquo;The book is on the table&amp;rdquo;. hehehe But&amp;hellip; not all strings are as obvious and require some further investigation. Our team has compiled a document (pt_BR) which not only explains how Launchpad and Rosetta work, but also has a section dedicated to some of the &amp;ldquo;hairy&amp;rdquo; strings we&amp;rsquo;ve come across.</description>

 The Perforce SCM System features comprehensive software configuration management capabilities built around a scalable client/server architecture.

      <description>Just like a teenager who&amp;rsquo;s about to get his driver&amp;rsquo;s license for the first time, I was as nervous as one can be early this morning (14:00 UTC), while attending my first Ubuntu Council meeting. One of the subjects to be discussed was my possible membership to the Ubuntu Members Team. Topic after topic were brought up and dealt with&amp;hellip; and as the minutes passed on by, I could barely remain calm&amp;hellip; I was afraid I&amp;rsquo;d choke during my presentation and not say anything useful, but then&amp;hellip; a huge calm came over me&amp;hellip; and I spoke!</description>

      <description>Finally!!! After so many months of working hard on the brazilian portuguese translations, we can now celebrate and enjoy the new Ubuntu release, my first release as part of the Ubuntu family! The work itself is enormous and yet delicate at the same time. There were many people who showed interest in lending us a helping hamd, but during the long winding road, it was a smaller group that emerged from the ashes!</description>

      <description>Managed to install Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger) on my laptop last night! Very impressive, including the fact that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to manually download the driver and firmware for my ipw2200 wifi card!!! And just take a look at the ultra sexy notification message on the upper right hand corner of the screen!!! After adding more repositories to my source.list, I proceeded to install Banshee and Gajim! F-Spot will be joining them next!</description>

      <description>I still have a few copies of Ubuntu Hacks left from the batch I received from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.Ã‚Â If you live around New York City and don&amp;rsquo;t mind driving/walking/biking to Fort Lee, NJ (right across the George Washington Bridge), I could give it to you.Ã‚Â The plan was to give them together with the new Dapper CDs, but unfortunately mine are taking longer to arrive.
Anyhow, we could meet at the local StarBucks store and chit-chat while getting caffeinated.</description>

      <description>Lately I have found myself hanging out at #ubuntu on irc.freenode.org, mostly listening and lending a helping hand whenver I can. It sort of reminds me of what I think Open Source and Community really means! I have personally gotten insulted in the past by some pretty lame IRC users who assume that everyone is an idiot and who can&amp;rsquo;t say anything helpfull but repeat &amp;ldquo;rtfm&amp;rdquo; to every enquire. But I will not go off on a tangent here and rant about all those &amp;ldquo;newbie basher&amp;rdquo; loosers out there.</description>

I have spent quite some time helping out the Brazilian Ubuntu community these last 2 months and I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready for the next level of involvement!
The meeting will take place via IRC and I can barely wait to see what comes out of this!</description>

      <description>Today I managed to get some free time from work (I had to run this process that usually takes 55 minutes to complete) and decided to pop the CD for the new version of Ubuntu Linux, codenamed Dapper Drake, into a friend&amp;rsquo;s TabletPC (HP model TC1100).
I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t really know what to expect but was gladly surprised to see the welcoming site of Gnome&amp;rsquo;s splash screen, followed by the soothing startup sound.</description>

      <description>Just created the following Ubuntu Brainstorm idea called &amp;ldquo;Translation workflow and collaboration with upstream&amp;rdquo;. It is based off the blueprint I created a while back in an attempt to improve the relationship between Ubuntu and upstream translation projects.

Everyone who knows me well knows how important translations are to me! How I strive to get people to always work with upstream and then let their work trickle down to distributions!</description>

      <description>it is amazing just how little real information gets its way to the American public these days. What we Americans call news must be the equivalent of a soap opera or comic stand up everywhere else in the world! The problem is so serious that for those who were born here and never left the country that you end up becoming utterly unaware of what else is going on around the world or, even worse in my oppinion, not knowing what kind of terrorism (our government calls it Foreign Policy) we are perpetrating outside of our borders.</description>

      <description>Read some posts of people talking about Audioscrobbler today and decided to see what the noise was all about.
 Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin for your media player (Winamp, iTunes, XMMS, foobar2000, etc..). Plugins send the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening statistics.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a GNU/Linux user for quite some time now, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 2 years ago that I became a fulltime user. Being a .NET and Oracle developer by day working for the Department of Education of NYC, I had a standard developer environment at my desk and nothing else. That means that I could not install anything else on my system, due to some extremelly archaic policies put in place by the employer (I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even search for information online and was told I should do it from home and bring the results to work the next day!</description>

      <description>Every time I need to add an image to one of my posts, I use a very simple tool to upload it to my Flickr account first. Once the image is uploaded, all there is left to do is write the post and paste the corresponding URL from the Flickr site for every image you want to publish together with your article. Even though most tools out there used to perform this task were written for the Windows plataform, I know of a few that were written for the Linux community, such as F-Spot and FlickrUploadr.</description>

      <description>To all my friends who use Windows for their daily tasks (usually at work) and enjoy tinkering with Ruby, now there&amp;rsquo;s a way to write, edit, and debug your Ruby code within Visual Studio .NET 2005. Note that I&amp;rsquo;m not refering to Ruby.NET, an implementation being developed by Dr. Wayne Kelly and Prof. John Gough of the Queensland University of Technology. This tip was sent my way by my friend Gerrard Lindsay, a Microsoft consultant for the East Region of the United States.</description>

      <description>One of the many things I maintain outside work is a blog aggregator (aka &amp;ldquo;planet&amp;rdquo;) for blogs about open source and technology from the Brazilian community. I try to invite new authors to this &amp;ldquo;planet&amp;rdquo; who have something interesting to share about their lives, regardless of what Linux distribution they use, gender, political views or religious beliefs. It is not as popular as some of the other Brazilian news sites, but I think it has a good number of subscribers.</description>

      <description>Today I complete yet another life cycle, version 3.2! Some bugs have been fixed and the &amp;ldquo;application&amp;rdquo; seems to be a bit more robust. New bugs I&amp;rsquo;m sure will be discovered (and hopefully reported too), and even a &amp;ldquo;fork&amp;rdquo; seems to be stabilizing in the shape of my (almost) 5-year-old daughter! ;)
This last year marked my de facto entry into the open source world! Together with other people, we founded Planeta Ubuntu Brasil, a blog aggregator completely designed for brazilian portuguese speaking users, and helped place the Ubuntu Brasil community on the map!</description>

      <description>Here is what&amp;rsquo;s kept me up late these last 3 nights: Installing Gentoo Linux onto Houdini (AMD 64 3400+ 1GB RAM) and getting Windows XP to run under VMWare. This may be a bit unorthodox but I wanted to have access to some Windows-only applications (such as Visual Studio 2003) without having to keep an extra computer at home with the sole purpose of running Windows. I wonder if I can install and play WoW under this scenario without much of a performance loss?</description>

Ever since we released Ubuntu Edgy I made the decision of giving the leadership for the Brazilian Translation Team to someone else&amp;hellip; not because I had lost interest in this task, but because after over 1 year in this position, it is the right and just decision to let someone else get the same opportunity.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I heard/read from someone about this cool application that would fetch weather information and convert it into a wallpaper that got refreshed every so often. This program is called Weather-Wallpaper!
Since we like cool and simple applications, we quickly packaged it for Foresight Linux but realized that the weather information being displayed was using the metric system. Now, without starting stupid arguments about the fact that the United States uses the imperial system, I took upon myself to add that feature to the still young code.</description>

 Radio Tray 0.5.1  &amp;quot;It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of Radio Tray 0.5.1! I have been following the development of this tiny streaming media player from the very start and even cloned it so that I could play with it on BitBucket.&amp;quot;   Stop whining and improve your life  &amp;quot;During your day to day conversation with your friends and family members, do you find yourself talking about work or life in general in a negative manner?</description>

      <description>After enjoying several days of free wi-fi hotspots pretty much every where I went, my mom&amp;rsquo;s neighbor finally turned the WEP on and I spent a un-wired Friday afternoon. Took the time to do some reading and watched some tv. Went home Saturday morning and found out my main computer&amp;rsquo;s power supply had gone kaput&amp;hellip; Luckly there is a computer supply store literally around the block and $40 later I was back on business.</description>

Been working hard together with FÃƒÂ¡bio Nogueira on the XFCE translations before the eminent 4.4.2 release. Things are looking really good!
Tonight I was feeling a bit adventurous and took the pre-alpha Foresight 2.0 KDE Edition and installed it at home. Like I said, I was really feeling adventurous and installed the x86_64 bit version too, and so far everything looks good!</description>

      <description>What does it mean when your direct supervisor keeps asking you to do some of his tasks and you know for a fact there&amp;rsquo;s no promotion involved? I guess my biggest &amp;ldquo;beef&amp;rdquo; is the type of stuff he asks me to write about:
 What is .NET and what advantages does it offer? What are the advantages of using Microsoft Visual Source Safe (VSS)? What are the requirements for working on the code library we just purchased and have no documentation on?</description>

Radio Tray, your favorite light weight online radio streaming application, has gone under some more development churn since its last release. Namely, there is now a dbus interface to allow other applications to interact with it! So you write a &amp;ldquo;remote control&amp;rdquo; for Radio Tray and change the volume, change stations, extract metadata from the stream being played, etc. Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s currently supported:
 listRadios() getCurrentRadio() playRadio(name) turnOff() volumeUp() volumeDown() getCurrentMetaData()  Fancy learning a bit about adding a dbus interface to your own application?</description>

      <description>Everyone who knows me online or is used to seeing me hanging out on several IRC channels or posting messages in my Twitter/Identi.ca accounts may have noticed my absense these last few weeks. Work, family and school have really kept me on my toes and my &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; life had to take the back seat.
I want to believe that I have done a decent job at juggling all the tasks I have been assigned, even if it means to do my school assignments while I eat lunch, as I did today!</description>

He had come down to my neck of the woods to visit his &amp;ldquo;special friend&amp;rdquo; and managed to take some time off to hang out. We mostly talked about our last camping trip and, as expected, about computers! He ended up picking up the tab, which made me wish I had order the filet mignon!</description>

Ambrose, a book about the story of the men ofÂ E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne, U.S. Army infantry. Back in 2006 HBO had turned this book into a 10-episodes mini series which I avidly watched in one shot one day while visiting my friend Vinny in Massachusetts.</description>

The reason why I&amp;rsquo;m writing about this is because I have received complaints from 3 different sources, citing how extremelly annoying it is to see my &amp;lsquo;gotchi showing up in their news reader dujour.</description>

      <description>Kudos for everyone involved with the translation of open source software out there, specially for those understand the different between QUANTITY and QUALITY! The following is for your enjoyment:
 When officials asked for the Welsh translation of a road sign, they thought the reply was what they needed. Unfortunately, the e-mail response to Swansea council said in Welsh: &amp;ldquo;I am not in the office at the moment. Please send any work to be translated&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Today is a very special moment for all of those who were involved with the release of yet another stable GNOME, version 2.22. It also marks the release for another stable Foresight Linux, version 2, keeping the tradition of always releasing together with GNOME! That is a lot of number 2s! :) I want to congratulate everyone who&amp;rsquo;s helped for the last 6 months, specially the Brazilian translation team that once again delivered a 100% translated GNOME desktop, and the Foresight guys for delivering a great combination of bleeding edge technologies (PulseAudio, PackageKit, Syslinux)!</description>

      <title>WinForms on Mono</title>

      <description>Been spending some time converting my pet application BillReminder (written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET) so that it can run on Linux&amp;hellip; but this time, without the Gtk# libraries for all the graphical rendering! Since I&amp;rsquo;m currently running Mono version 1.1.3 that comes bundled with Ubuntu Dapper, I can tap on to the new features including the port of the System.Windows.Forms namespace!!!
I must confess, the conversion process has been very minimal, and the only thing I have to pick on is the native look of the widgets&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;m missing some other package, but the quality, or lack of, of all widgets needs some serious work&amp;hellip; But is ok&amp;hellip; Just the fact that I can write code that has the potential of being executed in several other plataforms is exactly what I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for all along!</description>

When it comes to distributing source code, specially python code, I really wish there was a concise and detailed best practice guide for using distutils! Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, the documentation is pretty good and covers a lot of ground, but what I really want is a standard &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo; if you will, that python developers can take and do some minimal modifications to customize it to their needs.</description>

      <description>No, I did not get hired to work for Pixar. [sigh] I just wanted to point you to this interesting article describing the working environment there.
 A lot of the animators decided early on that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want cubicles, so instead, Pixar found these groovy little cottages that they bought for them. Walking through the animation department is like walking through a neighborhood for dwarves. Lots of little houses laid out along Ã¢â‚¬Å&amp;quot;streets,Ã¢â‚¬Â?</description>

      <description>I was reading Digg this morning when I came across a post talking about the 8 best games for Linux. I was immediately attracted to a picture of the game World of Padman, which at first glance seemed to be a game for children, but don&amp;rsquo;t let it fool you.

The first thing I did was watch this video. That is when I noticed that it looked a lot like a cartoon-ish version of Quake, but with funny characters.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud to announce that the XFCE desktop environment, well known for being a lighter alternative to GNOME or KDE, is completely translated (upstream) to Brazilian Portuguese!

A total of over 80 different programs and components off the XFCE and Goodies repositories, with over 6000 strings, I believe that XFCE is the first complex desktop environment to be completely translated to Brazilian Portuguese! The core components had been 100% translated for about 1 week now, as can be see in the stats page, mas yesterday I finished my research and noticed that all the other components were also finished.</description>

      <description>What a great month for open source translators this has been! The latest news is the marriage of GNOME&amp;rsquo;s Damn Lies with Vertimus. You can think of it as statistics and work flow in one interface! From the announcement email:
 You like Damned Lies and Vertimus, we too, so we have merged both! The new Damned Lies offers a new reviewing workflow. If you&amp;rsquo;re a translator, you can join one or many teams and reserve a module for translation.</description>

Since I use Gaim for all my instant messenger needs, here&#39;s the info on how to set it up.</description>

I cherry picked a few pictures of her first year and created a set. It is amazing how time does fly&amp;hellip; she&amp;rsquo;s going to be 7 at the end of the year!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back home, together with my wife and daughters. The two days spent in the hospital helped them (wife and baby) to recharge a bit their energies, and gave me some time to spend with my older daughter.
Many were the comments and emails I received during this period, all congratulating us and wishing us well. I even received a phone call from Brazil (thanks a million Kurt Kraut)! In the name of my (now slightly bigger) family I thank each and everyone of you for the kind words!</description>
