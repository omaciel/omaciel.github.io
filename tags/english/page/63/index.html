I finally managed to see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very pleased with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Thomas Haden Church (Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous adventures.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Jakub Steiner from Planet Gnome mentioned an old article written by Joel Spolsky on the importance of writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time to absorb his &ldquo;pearls of wisdom.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure all your snacks are within reach so you don&rsquo;t have to miss your favorite soap.</div>

So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.</div>
