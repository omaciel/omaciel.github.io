Since I&rsquo;m currently running Mono version 1.1.3 that comes bundled with Ubuntu Dapper, I can tap on to the new features including the port of the System.Windows.Forms namespace!!!
I must confess, the conversion process has been very minimal, and the only thing I have to pick on is the native look of the widgets&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m missing some other package, but the quality, or lack of, of all widgets needs some serious work&hellip; But is ok&hellip; Just the fact that I can write code that has the potential of being executed in several other plataforms is exactly what I&rsquo;ve been looking for all along!</div>
