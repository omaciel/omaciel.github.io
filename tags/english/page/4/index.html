As a matter of fact, I am already the survivor of 2 other mildly successful attempts, which sadly, died prematurely due to commitment issues from my partners and my inability to record and edit audio using Linux.
About 6 months ago the need to scratch this itch came back in full power, and thanks to the support of my friend Evandro Pastor, Castálio Podcast was born!</div>
