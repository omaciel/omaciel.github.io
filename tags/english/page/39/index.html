                <div class="d-block text-truncate">So yesterday I finally managed to get a hold of another HP TC1100 and bring it with me to the MySQL Meetup last night. There were many interesting things during our first ever &ldquo;show &amp; tell&rdquo; session, which shall get mentioned on a later post, but all I really wanted to do was to install Ubuntu onto the TabletPC and try to get everything working.
The new and extremelly easy to follow 5-step installation process was readly approved by all, and in approximately 15 minutes I had a complete system, minus support for the stylus pen&hellip; yet.</div>

New bugs I&rsquo;m sure will be discovered (and hopefully reported too), and even a &ldquo;fork&rdquo; seems to be stabilizing in the shape of my (almost) 5-year-old daughter! ;)
This last year marked my de facto entry into the open source world! Together with other people, we founded Planeta Ubuntu Brasil, a blog aggregator completely designed for brazilian portuguese speaking users, and helped place the Ubuntu Brasil community on the map!</div>

I honestly didn&rsquo;t really know what to expect but was gladly surprised to see the welcoming site of Gnome&rsquo;s splash screen, followed by the soothing startup sound.</div>

After so many months of working hard on the brazilian portuguese translations, we can now celebrate and enjoy the new Ubuntu release, my first release as part of the Ubuntu family! The work itself is enormous and yet delicate at the same time. There were many people who showed interest in lending us a helping hamd, but during the long winding road, it was a smaller group that emerged from the ashes!</div>
