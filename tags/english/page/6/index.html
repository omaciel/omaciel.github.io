                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Over the holidays I got a second-hand Kindle DX from my sister. As I have been doing some serious reading these last couple of years, an EBook reader was something that both excited and scared me at the same time. Let me explain.
Being able to carry several books, often pretty thick and heavy, in one simple and light device has its advantages. Add to that the massive number of free EBooks and regular plain text books available on web sites such as the Internet Archive, Open Library, Project Gutenberg, and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re talking about having your own private and portable library on the go!</div>

During this period I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve the user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you should have a good time playing with it.</div>
