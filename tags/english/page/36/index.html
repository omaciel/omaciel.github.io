                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Shortly after reading the note about a VMWare image of the operating system for the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), my curiosity got the best of me and I promptly started downloading it into my laptop (roughly 180 MB) and waited for my lunch break to give it a spin.

Eventhough I have met people who have claimed to hate it to death, I still consider it to be the best invention since the invention of sliced bread!
However, something very peculiar happens if you install it after you&rsquo;ve already used your laptop to access a.. uhh&hellip; access point: the little Network Manager applet won&rsquo;t detect the wireless device!</div>

APTonCD is a tool with a graphical interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs (you choose the type of media) with all of the packages you&rsquo;ve downloaded via APT-GET or APTITUDE, creating a removable repository that you can use on other computers. APTonCD will also allow you to automatically create media with all of your .deb packages located in one especific repository, so that you can install them into your computers without the need for an internet conection.</div>
