I wrote that a while back and though it still does contain some helpful commands, I figured it was about time I updated it. Well, it took me longer than I expected to find some time and clean it up, but I think I can now show you a brand new script which also includes the extra feature of downloading a manifest file directly from Red Hat's portal and importing it as part of the process.</div>

Yesterday I had one of those &ldquo;once in a a lifetime&rdquo; opportunities, thanks to my wife who dragged me to a presentation hosted by the University of North Carolina. The presentation by Dr. Eduardo Torres Cuevas, titled &ldquo;Preserving Cuba&rsquo;s Cultural Heritage in the 21st Century&rdquo; attracted a small gathering, apparently mostly made up of UNC staff and students who are currently enrolled in one of their languages courses. I wasn&rsquo;t really sure what to expect from it, but being the supportive husband that I am, I signed off from work a bit earlier and together with our 2 kids we drove to the main campus.</div>

 Dear Og Maciel,
Congratulations on your one-year anniversary with Red Hat! Thank you for your commitment and work over the past year. We hope that it has been everything you expected it to be and look forward to celebrating your future success with the company.
 Time sure flies when you&rsquo;re having too much fun! I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been one whole year since I joined Red Hat as a Senior QA Engineer to work on their CloudForms project!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Just wanted to follow up on my previous post in regards to how to resize the root partition of an EC2 instance. Turns out that, once you&rsquo;ve edited the root partition while in the launch panel, you can then perform the resize command right away, as soon as the instance is up and running and you have ssh&rsquo;ed to it.
 [root@ip-aa-bb-cc-dd ~]# resize2fs /dev/xvde1
 This is definitely better than what I thought one had to do to get a bigger root partition.</div>

The reasons for the long hiatus are too many to enumerate, but suffice to say that the project is very much alive and I intend to keep updating the translations database as often as possible.
So, what&rsquo;s new?</div>
