      <description>Woke up to the following email this morning:
 Dear Og Maciel,
Congratulations on your one-year anniversary with Red Hat! Thank you for your commitment and work over the past year. We hope that it has been everything you expected it to be and look forward to celebrating your future success with the company.
 Time sure flies when you&amp;rsquo;re having too much fun! I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been one whole year since I joined Red Hat as a Senior QA Engineer to work on their CloudForms project!</description>
