      <description>For my last post of 2014 I wanted to show, with pictures, the books I read and spent so much time with this year.
Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my Reading Challenge. I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time, read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much younger.</description>
