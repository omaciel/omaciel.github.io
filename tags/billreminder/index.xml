      <description>Just in time before the new year, it is with great pleasure that I announce the release of BillReminder &amp;ldquo;Keep Their Heads Ringing&amp;quot;Â 0.4.0 after a 27-month hiatus! During this period I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve the user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you should have a good time playing with it.</description>
