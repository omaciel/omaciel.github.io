                <div class="d-block text-truncate">For a while Foresight Linux users had no graphical interface for managing their systems packages and/or updates, mainly because the development for the conary backend fell out of scope and our radar (this is a nicer way to say that we didn&rsquo;t have someone to maintain it). But thanks to the work of zodman, jesse and others PackageKit is making its way back to our desktop.

In the past, my contributions were mostly related to translating applications to Brazilian Portuguese, but my role on that front was very minimal this time and consisted of a handful of translations and several commits of the awesome work done by others. Most of my contributions for 3.0 are related to the work I do for the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors, but I won&rsquo;t bore you to tears!</div>
