      <description>On a previous post I had promised to comment on the movie Sideways. I finally managed to see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very pleased with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Thomas Haden Church (Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous adventures.</description>
