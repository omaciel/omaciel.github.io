Yesterday I had one of those &amp;ldquo;once in a a lifetime&amp;rdquo; opportunities, thanks to my wife who dragged me to a presentation hosted by the University of North Carolina. The presentation by Dr. Eduardo Torres Cuevas, titled &amp;ldquo;Preserving Cuba&amp;rsquo;s Cultural Heritage in the 21st Century&amp;rdquo; attracted a small gathering, apparently mostly made up of UNC staff and students who are currently enrolled in one of their languages courses. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to expect from it, but being the supportive husband that I am, I signed off from work a bit earlier and together with our 2 kids we drove to the main campus.</description>

      <description>After driving approximately 1,014 miles over this Memorial Day weekend, I&amp;rsquo;m finally back home from Chapel Hill. Had a blast visiting my sister together with my wife and daughter. My older sister and uncle also tagged along to supposedly help out with the driving. Went to sleep at 1am on Thursday and got up at 4am!!! Managed to get there by 3pm and was completely overwhelmed by a feeling of peace.</description>

      <description>My personal quest of gathering as much information as possible on the requirements to enroll into a PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill continued last Friday. I was up and early for my appointments at the Department of Computer Science considering I went to sleep really late the previous night. It was my sister&amp;rsquo;s birthday so I took her out to the movies and a late dinner.</description>

      <description>Arrived here in North Carolina last night at the Raleigh-Durham airport. My younger sister was waiting for me and as soon as we picked up my luggage we headed to her apartment in Chapel Hill. Woke up early today and went to my first (and only) meeting with the chair of the School of Information and Library Science at UNC. My sister had set up the meeting for me and I must admit I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure if I wanted to spend the time to talk to someone from a department that had the word &amp;ldquo;library&amp;rdquo; in it.</description>

      <description>This Wednesday I embark on what may be the most important trip of my life: I&amp;rsquo;ll be visiting and interviewing with the chairs of several different departments at the North Carolina Univertsity with the objective of gathering information for my possible come back to the academic world. It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 8 years since I graduated from Pace University and my plans of earning a PhD/MD diploma have taken a major detour.</description>
