      <description>Earlier this year OSNews published my article titled &amp;quot;Installing Debian Linux For The Faint Of Heart.&amp;quot; Today I came across another article dealing with the same subject. Now, I know people have hammered these types of articles to death in the net but this one sounded worth the risk of mentioning. For one thing, it covers hardening your bare-bones Debian server which, IMHO should be worth looking at no matter what.</description>

      <description>With the upcoming release of Whidbey (Visual Studio 2005) scheduled for some time this Summer, Microsoft has already been busy working on the next 2 versions: Orca and Hawaii. &amp;quot;Microsoft officials said that while Whidbey will help developers target the upcoming Longhorn operating system, Orcas will be the version of the tool set that will enable developers to ride what the company calls the Longhorn wave and tap the new features of the operating system.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know you could do all of these with rss!!! Wow!!! Read the original post here.
 Get the news as it happens from multiple news sources  An RSS feed reader is an aggregator of numerous feeds from news sources (and nearly every major paper and TV news network has RSS feeds today). But now there are even feeds that aggregate other feeds. The new RSSmix.com lets you combine all the news source RSS feeds into one single feed so you get news as it happens.</description>

      <description>My sister had told me about this when she called to wish us a happy Easter. She was very excited about it and thought I&amp;rsquo;d feel the same. For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t read any &amp;ldquo;geek news&amp;rdquo; or avoid any conversations that don&amp;rsquo;t relate to music videos or movies: Wired magazine published an article in this month&amp;rsquo;s issue about &amp;ldquo;How four underdogs from the mean streets of Phoenix took on the best from M.</description>

      <description>An interesting read (sorry&amp;hellip; free registration required) about Brazil&amp;rsquo;s involvement with the Open Source movement. It seems that Linux has joined Soccer as this country&amp;rsquo;s passion. The New York Times says &amp;ldquo;Brazil: Free Software&amp;rsquo;s Biggest and Best Friend&amp;rdquo;.
 Looking to save millions of dollars in royalties and licensing fees, Mr. da Silva has instructed government ministries and state-run companies to gradually switch from costly operating systems made by Microsoft and others to free operating systems, like Linux.</description>
