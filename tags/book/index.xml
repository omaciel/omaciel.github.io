      <description>It seems that my last post was from September 03, 2021, so perhaps at the &amp;ldquo;risk&amp;rdquo; of starting up this blogging thing once again, here&amp;rsquo;s what I wrote down as I sat down to ponder on what I&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this past 2022. In no particular order:
2022 in Retrospective   Writing
 Both &amp;ldquo;I.C.Q.&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Big Score&amp;rdquo; were translated and published by Brazilian publisher Editora InVerso and can be found at my Books page.</description>

      <title>The Big Score - First Draft</title>

      <description>This past May 31st, I added the final touches to the first draft for what should become my third book and second Young Adult novel.
Temporarily titled The Big Score and currently, at approximately 44,000 words, you could say that this book was the hardest I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far. While my previous book, &amp;ldquo;I.C.Q.,&amp;quot; took me around thirty contiguous days to complete the first draft, The Big Score started our back in November 1st as part of National Novel Writing Month 2020, and was only completed seven months later.</description>

      <description>This past July of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I managed to finally get started on a project that had been shelved for a while: write my second book.
From July 13th to the middle of August, I wrote fevereshly every day, working on what became &amp;ldquo;I.C.Q.,&amp;quot; my very first piece of fiction, which you can pre-order right now.
&amp;ldquo;Auggie Benson is a high school senior boy who freelances as a software developer and hacker after school to improve his skills and make some money on the side.</description>

      <description>Growing up my dad used to tell me that there are three important milestones on a man’s life (though I feel that the same could be said about any gender):
 Plant a tree Have a child Write a book  Through my life, I have planted quite a few trees, including a lemon and papaya tree I used to treat as my imaginary friends :)
I have also had the highest honor to be the father to three amazing girls!</description>

      <title>Software Quality Engineering: Tales From The Trenches</title>

      <description>First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love being a Quality Engineer, something that I have been doing for a living for the last 11 years of my life! During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</description>
