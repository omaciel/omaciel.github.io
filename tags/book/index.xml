      <description>This past July of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I managed to finally get started on a project that had been shelved for a while: write my second book.
From July 13th to the middle of August, I wrote fevereshly every day, working on what became &amp;ldquo;I.C.Q.,&amp;quot; my very first piece of fiction, which you can pre-order right now.
&amp;ldquo;Auggie Benson is a high school senior boy who freelances as a software developer and hacker after school to improve his skills and make some money on the side.</description>
