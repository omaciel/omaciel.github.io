      <description>Starting today I will be stuck attending some training class for work. These &amp;ldquo;classes&amp;rdquo; start at 9am and end at 4:30pm, all through Friday! Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll get a chance to grab a cup of coffee in the next 5 minutes. Managed to update this blog to WordPress 1.5.1. Since this was a bux-fixing release, don&amp;rsquo;t expect to find anything changed here.
As a side note, am looking forward to some WoW playing time with Vinny tonight!</description>

      <description>Last night was my weekly night to play games with my friend Vinny. I have been playing Enemy Territory every Wednesday night since last Summer with a few cancellations here and there. Earlier this year Vinny convinced me to try World of Warcraft, a very addictive online multiplayer game. I was hooked from the start but not being able to &amp;ldquo;dedicate&amp;rdquo; to more than a couple of hours a week I eventually lost interest.</description>
