      <description>RssReaderNET - v0.0.2
Originally uploaded by omaciel.
Haven&amp;rsquo;t received any offers of help with my RssReader.NET application&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I was expecting offers anyhow. :) Yesterday and today I spent some time making some changes to the UI as well adding some new functionality. UI changes include:
 Removed ComboBox control - Users will have to add new feeds via an interface. Switched ListView control for a TreeView control - Will allow for expansion/collapsing of feeds and increase visibility of available posts.</description>

      <description>Been spending some time using the RSS.NET library (&amp;quot;RSS.NET is an open-source .NET class library for RSS feeds. It provides a reusable object model for parsing and writing RSS feeds. It is fully compatible with RSS versions 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, and 2.0.1, implementing all constructs.&amp;quot; and decided to create my own Rss reader. It still has a long way to go but it is in a semi-usefull state. I know there&amp;rsquo;s a million rss readers out there but if anyone is interested in working on this with me just drop me a line.</description>
