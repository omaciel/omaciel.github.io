            <article><p>Not in a blogging mood today&hellip; Got home last night at <strong>9:30pm(!!!)</strong>
and checked my messages: 1 new message! An old girl-friend crying and
mumbbling about her sister (also an old good friend) having an
accident&hellip; broken up telephone number to call back (she must have
called from a cell phone&hellip; had to rewind message 2 times&hellip; Call number
and a guy answers&hellip; After introductions (&ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m an old friend of such
and such&hellip;&quot;) learn that the sister had apparently &ldquo;thrown herself out
the window of her second floor apartment.&rdquo; Find out which hospital she
is and try to call&hellip; &ldquo;Vising hours are over!&rdquo; Shortly after a friend of
the girl calls me and tells me a bit more info&hellip; Terrible accident due
to alcohol&hellip; Fell off the fire exit ladder&hellip; broke 3rd vertebrae&hellip;
just had surgery&hellip; removed a rib and used to to replace
vertebrae(????)&hellip; Today I didn&rsquo;t go to work and went early to the
hospital. Spent 3 1/2 hours with my friend, trying to cheer her up and
just plainly keep her company. Later in the morning an aunt showed up
and stayed untill I left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known this girl for almost 10 years but had not seen or heard of
her for the last 8. About 1 1/2 months ago I learned that she was back
in town (not knowing she was out of town for a couple of years) and
decided to get a hold of her. A week later took her out with my family
for a very casual dinner. It felt as if we had never been &ldquo;disconnected&rdquo;
for 8 years and our conversations picked up right at the point where we
had left off. Saturday night she had dinner at my house, where I amazed
her with one of my 2 laptops running Ubuntu linux while fixing her
Windows XP laptop. Sunday morning she calls me to give her some
information on installing Office. Sunday evening she apparently went on
a &ldquo;drinking spree&rdquo; culminating with her &ldquo;forced landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last time I heard of her today she had somewhat feelings on her
legs/toes&hellip; She&rsquo;s only 22 years old&hellip;</p>
