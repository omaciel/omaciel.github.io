                </p>

            
            <article><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote anything on my blog so here are
some interesting nuggets:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been <strong>house hunting</strong> for the last 3-4 months and I can
honestly say that it is a very intense experience! There are so many
things to learn and remember and so many different things to
consider! Wouldn&rsquo;t be nice if you knew right up front all the costs
and fees involved in purchasing a house, the same way you know how
much it costs to purchase a pair of sneakers (cost of sneakers plus
sales tax)? Alas, the hard work has paid off and in about 3 weeks
I&rsquo;ll be a home owner for the first time!</li>
<li>Work has kept me very busy these last few months but thanks to some
new goals and new hires, the future is looking pretty bright for
<strong>rPath</strong> and I&rsquo;m very excited to be a part of it all! I managed to
hack on a proof of concept for a <strong>Django</strong>-based tool for our
<strong>QA</strong> department which received a good deal of good feedback! I&rsquo;ve
also spent some time cleaning up our wiki and getting things ready
for the new QA engineer who&rsquo;s starting in a few weeks.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a>, my distribution of
choice for the last 3 years, has undergone a lot of updates and
changes these last few weeks, including a new sub-project called
&ldquo;<a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.org/display/boots/Home">Boots</a>&rdquo;, a
<strong>Fedora</strong> remix. Basically, &ldquo;Boots is proposed to be as faithful as
possible an import of the upstream binary platform packages, within
the constraints of being repackaged for <strong>Conary</strong> using <strong>Conary</strong>
best practices.&rdquo; Also, as <strong>Foresight</strong> follows a rolling release
model, I&rsquo;m enjoying having latest <strong>Firefox, Chromium, kernel
2.6.30.x, Xorg 7.4, OpenOffice 3.1.1</strong> only an update away. <strong>GNOME
2.28</strong> is already in our development label and should be hitting the
stable branch soon!</li>
<li>Speaking about <strong>GNOME</strong>, the Brazilian translation team went
through a (<strong>much needed</strong>) last minute change in the coordination
and the entire team rallied to deliver, once again, a completely
translated desktop! Though the new coordinator lacks experience
using git and managing a translation team, he makes up with a good
attitude and humility.</li>
<li>Still talking about translations, I&rsquo;ve been keeping the <a href="https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://rbatest02.eng.rpath.com/api/products/transifex">Transifex
Appliance</a>
up to date on both development and stable fronts. Thanks to the
power of having a system version controlled management modelÂ under
my finger prints, maintaining and delivering the appliance in
synchrony with the development and release schedule of the the
<a href="http://transifex.org/">Transifex</a> project is child&rsquo;s play!</li>
<li>I spent some time playing with
<a href="http://live.gnome.org/ProjectMallard">Mallard</a> and using it to
implement a new <a href="http://github.com/omaciel/foresight-user-guide">User
Guide</a> for
<strong>Foresight Linux</strong>! In the next few weeks I will also port
<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/">Cheese</a> to mallard so that they
can also enjoy of this great documentation tool! Speaking of Cheese,
I had the pleasure of lending a helping hand proofreading the <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/cheese/tour">tour
page</a> and was honored that
<strong>Daniel Siegel</strong> asked my permission to use my <strong>daughter&rsquo;s
pictures</strong> to show off the new 2.28 features! Thanks dude! :)</li>
<li>When not going nuts over the many different inspections needed for
purchasing a house, reviewing and committing translations,
maintaining packages and software appliances or spending quality
time with my family, I try to keep up with my new year&rsquo;s resolution
from last year of reading a book every day during my lunch break.
I&rsquo;ve read quite a few books this year, some times juggling more than
one book at a time. Lately I&rsquo;ve been finishing up &ldquo;<strong>The Last of the
Mohicans</strong>&quot; and am gearing up to start reading Â &quot;<a href="http://emblemdivide.wordpress.com/">Emblem
Divide</a>&rdquo;, a novel by my good
friend <strong>Pete Savage</strong>. My curiosity got the best of me and I just
had to read the first page! :) The best part of the book in my
opinion is not as much as all the &ldquo;easter eggs&rdquo; he sprinkled here
and there, but the reason why he wrote it! Want to know about it?
Check out the web site for the book! :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess this is about it for now. If I haven&rsquo;t replied to your email,
please accept my apologies. I have a pretty lengthy cue of emails to
reply and I&rsquo;ll try to get back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to
ping me on <strong>IRC</strong> (nick is <strong>OgMaciel</strong> in pretty much all servers,
including <strong>Freenode</strong> and <strong>GimpNet</strong>) as your chances of getting a
reply will be much higher. :)</p>
