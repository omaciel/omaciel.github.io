<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m still alive and kicking. Been really busy at work and haven&rsquo;t
had the time or energy to write anything here. I have however kept my
<strong>New Year&rsquo;s resolution</strong> of reading a book during lunch break every
day! I&rsquo;m currently reading 2 books at the same time (check what other
books I have read and those I have still waiting on my queue in the
front page of my blog):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For The Win</strong> by Cory Doctorow</li>
<li><strong>The Fourth Part of the World</strong> by Toby Lester</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that it is impossible to read Doctorow&rsquo;s book and not feel the
urge to play <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml">World of
Warcraft</a> (WoW). Impossible! I
think the last time I played this game I still lived in <strong>Northern New
Jersey</strong> and was an <strong>Ubuntu user</strong> (yeah, I&rsquo;ve matured since then).</p>
<p>So I wanted to play WoW really bad after reading a chapter but wasn&rsquo;t
sure how to do it since I only run <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> and didn&rsquo;t feel like
setting up a <strong>Windows VM</strong> just to play a game! Talking to my long time
friend <a href="http://awkward-silence.com/">Vinny</a> I suddenly realized that I
never tried to run the game using <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, so I
decided that once I got home I&rsquo;d take it for a spin.</p>
<p>After downloading a 3.3MB installer from Blizzard, and installing Wine
(<em>sudo conary update wine</em>), I went ahead and ran <em>wineÂ TryWoW.exe</em>.
What followed was a series of screens where I simply accepted the
defaults and clicked my way through. There were times when a dialog with
no messages popped up where all you could do was click on the OK
button&hellip; so I did.</p>
<p>The installation did require access to the internet and a bundle of
approximately 35MB was downloaded in the process. Once the wizard
finished I had the option to play the game right there and then! How
exciting!</p>
<p>The game takes a few extra seconds to start but eventually I was face to
face with the login window. However, I noticed that I had no audio and
the video quality lacked a bit. Googling around brought me to
theseÂ <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft">instructions</a>.
So I modified my configuration file to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SET gxApi &ldquo;opengl&rdquo; SET Sound_SoundOutputSystem &ldquo;1&rdquo; SET
Sound_SoundBufferSize &ldquo;150&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was it!!! I spent the next 45 minutes playing the game using my
trial account and had to be dragged by my wife and kids to the kitchen
to eat diner with them! :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very satisfied with the experience and extremely pleased with the
stability of Wine! Since I have 2 monitors at home, my game window shows
up in one monitor while my &ldquo;normal&rdquo; desktop is on the other and I have
to be careful not to click outside of the game. If I do, then I cannot
go back into the game again and have to kill the process and start over.</p>
<p>Well, I still have a few more days until my trial period expires. Will I
then update to a full blown account and waste spend my free time
investing on my character? To be determined! :)</p>
