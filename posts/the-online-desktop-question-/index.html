            <article><p>I&rsquo;m glad <strong>Bryan Clark</strong>
<a href="http://clarkbw.net/blog/2007/11/29/foundation-candidates-and-the-online-desktop-question/">poked</a>
the candidates running for the GNOME Board about the Online Desktop
question. The best part was that he took the time to sift through all
the answers and derive a nice chart of what he understood from the
answers and what he felt needed some further explanation. So, to answer
his call&hellip;</p>
<p>When I said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that it is not up to the Board to decide on the
implementation or even which tools/languages to use, but serve as a
facilitator and guiding light to make sure that the project stays on
track and focused&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was stating like many of the other candidates that the Board should be
considered a bastion for the GNOME community, developers, contributors
and users. Working in unison as much as possible, it should provide the
support necessary to make sure ideas and projects come to fruition. I
repeat myself when I say that it should not get tangled up in the
intricacies of which languages to use but it should have an
understanding of the technologies in order to properly help delineate a
plan of action.</p>
<p>There was another question asked in the mailing list where I also point
out what the Board could do for the community:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, I feel that a little bit of public recognition to our past and
current collaborators could do everyone a great deal of good! Sure,
everyone who has ever helped in any way, shape or form has done it
without the expectations of fame and success. But if I can point out
the latest post by Olav[1] titled &ldquo;Stats&rdquo; as an example, it is a
great example of some public recognition to those who spend a great
deal of time down in the trenches. Take Daniel Nylander for instance.
This guy has been atop the commit list, bug triage and translations
for pretty much as far as I can remember. And he is only ONE of MANY
doing some great work for GNOME. You know those mugs I just recently
heard of that have been used as gifts to our partners? How about some
type of recognition plaque for those who are doing some outstanding
work for us? Or for those who are showing potential as a means to fuel
their drive? Remember, our users (and obviously our collaborators and
developers ARE our users too) are our biggest and most important
asset! [1] <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2007/11/21/stats/">http://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/2007/11/21/stats/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very excited about the Online Desktop project, as well as other
technologies that will allow us to provide a smooth experience to our
users such as <strong>PackageKit</strong>, and as a member of the Board I will strive
to reach out to the developers (and community in general) to make sure
that ideas can be expressed, discussed, and resources can be properly
allocated. Since most of the candidates support the Online Desktop
project, no matter who gets elected to the 7 positions, the project and
the entire community can expect the Board to put its collective weight
behind it!</p>
