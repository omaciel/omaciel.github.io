            <article><p>&hellip; or, how I finally got off my butt and became more involved with the
open source community.</p>
<p>It was not long ago, during one of my recent rants about open source not
always being open to non-contributors, that I first heard of Stephan
Hermann. He had written something that really clicked with my way of
thinking, and shortly after exchanging some emails/posts replies I was
convinced that it was about time I got more involved with the community.
I didn&rsquo;t want to be one of those individuals who talk a lot but doesn&rsquo;t
do anything about it. It was thanks to Stephan that I finally joined the
Ubuntu Brazilian (Portuguese) Translation Team in Launchpad and started
translating documents and applications for the upcoming release of
Ubuntu. Granted I couldn&rsquo;t spent much time every day on it, neither
could I hang out in #ubuntu for my company blocks all ports, I still
managed to squeeze a few minutes here and there&hellip; and it was a great
feeling knowing that my work will benefit hundreds of Portuguese
speaking people to use Ubuntu in their native language! And every time I
couldn&rsquo;t work on it, I wished I had more free time to contribute more!</p>
<p>Today I read yet another <a href="http://linux.blogweb.de/index.php?url=archives/116-Ubuntu-The-first-six-months-A-summary.html&amp;serendipity%5Bcsuccess%5D=true#feedback">inspirational
post</a>
by him. Once again his words inspired me to come up with other ways to
help out more! Though I&rsquo;m a developer with several years of experience,
I don&rsquo;t know a thing about packaging applications for Linux or how to
create/apply patches, etc. This lack of knowledge was my excuse for not
doing more&hellip; I&rsquo;m not ashamed to say that it has been my excuse for
quite some time. I really want to change this&hellip; I want to be able to
make a difference in this world! I hope to be able to take my first
steps towards this goal over this long weekend&hellip; and if I succeed, it
will be thanks to people like Stephan!</p>
