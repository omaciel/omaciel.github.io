            <article><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pmtorrone/2381346935/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/2381346935_d6a6c92b63_m_d.jpg" alt="image0"></a>It
is not very uncommon for me to receive some code requests from friends
looking for a little help to &ldquo;make something easier&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m talking about
those pesky day to day things that after a while makes you go: &ldquo;If I
could only push a button and have it done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This week I was chit-chatting with my good friend <strong>Evandro Pastor</strong>
when he mentioned one of these situations that, according to him, makes
his existence miserable. You see, Evandro is the brain, muscle and
talent behind <a href="http://bit.ly/cqMwY0">QuartoStudio</a>, &ldquo;a small studio
located in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil&rdquo; specialized in creating
websites and blogs for small to medium sized companies. We have worked
together many times on several different projects, and through the years
have become great friends.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Evandro was telling me how painful it is when a new client asks
him to migrate an existing web blog to a new host/domain and hands him a
tarball containing the exported content of a <strong>WordPress</strong> blog in
<strong>XML</strong> format. The problem resides on the issue that some web hosting
providers will limit how big a file can be uploaded via a POST method,
and depending on how big this XML file is, you may have to manually
break it into smaller files first.</p>
<p>So during my lunch break yesterday I took upon myself to create a script
that would do this for him so he wouldn&rsquo;t have to manually split files
and worry about making sure all the right tags were present and closed
appropriately. Of course I searched the web for a free/open source
alternative first but after several minutes later I still had not found
something that would do what he needed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&rsquo;ll just write one then!&quot;, I said to my self. My first stop was to
read up on <a href="http://bit.ly/c1Otx6">lxml</a> since I figured that using
something that could parse XML would be a better start than reading a
file and searching for tags within the file. Armed with this knowledge
and still enjoying the buzz from my freshly brewed cup of coffee, I set
out to write a couple of methods that take in a XML file, the number of
&ldquo;chunks&rdquo; you want to split it into, and I was done!</p>
<p>There was still a problem, however: Evandro would have to use the python
command line to do what he needed. Writing a command line tool then
became my next priority.</p>
<p>Since I have written command line tools in python before, my first
impulse was to copy some of the code I had already written somewhere
else and adapt it for this specific project&hellip; and so I did. Two minutes
later I had my first draft of a command line tool that could be invoked
from the shell the same way that <em>cp</em> or <em>ls</em> can. It was then that it
dawned on me that I had never really taken the time to really learn
about <a href="http://bit.ly/aX3PmV">optparse</a>, the &ldquo;convenient, flexible, and
powerful library for parsing command-line options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, my first stop was to read through the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
documentation. I then did a bit of <em>Googling</em> around and was pleased to
find an amazing introductory <a href="http://bit.ly/amtEtM">article</a> by
<strong>Alexander Sandler</strong>. If you have ever wanted to learn how to write a
command line tool and need to learn in detail about optparse, I highly
recommend his article to supplement the official documentation.</p>
<p>So Tuesday night, as I sat down to watch <strong>Lost</strong>, I added the finishing
touches to my script and was able to surprise Evandro with it the next
morning! Unfortunately this story does not have a 100% happy ending&hellip;
The script works as expected and it lets you configure how many &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;
to break the XML into, what tag to look for (defaults to
&ldquo;/rss/channel/item&rdquo;) and what to name the generated smaller files.
However, since a post or comment can have embedded HTML tags, lxml is
converting them to HTML entities&hellip; aaaand <strong>WordPress</strong> doesn&rsquo;t like
that! Aaaand it turns out that the XML file generated by <a href="http://bit.ly/dleUnH">WordPress is
not really XML</a> per se but its own WRX format. :/</p>
<p>Not everything is lost though. I did learn more about optparse and using
lxml to parse XML files! By the way, if anyone has some more information
on how I can make lxml ignore html tags, please drop me a line! :)</p>
