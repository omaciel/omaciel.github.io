            <article><p>The depth of the WWW never ceases to amaze me. Every day there&rsquo;s a new
world out there for you to discoverer! I do browse a handfull of sites
every day religiously but sometimes I crave for new material. Reading
blogs have given me the opportunity to &ldquo;interact&rdquo; with a much larger
audience with an even wider and diverse background&hellip; and tastes&hellip; and
points of view&hellip; About 2 days ago I came across <a href="http://www.redmonk.com/sogrady/">Stephen
O&rsquo;Grady</a>'s blog and was hooked to his
style of writing immediately. Today's entry titled &ldquo;On Blogs,
Multi-Tasking and Continuous Partial Attention&rdquo; was very, but very
interesting for it touched upon a subject that has been afflicting me
for quite some time now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I simply have too much to do. Too much to read, too much to write, too
much everything. This fact is as immutable as the laws of
thermodynamics. While there&rsquo;s always room for improvement in my
overall efficiency, ultimately the equation is simple: the information
to free time ratio is solidly tilted in the direction of the former.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever since I joined &ldquo;corporate America&rdquo; shortly after college my life
has turned completely upside down. I feel like I&rsquo;m living inside Pink
Floyd&rsquo;s The Wall music video. Every day you take your place on this
conveyor belt inside a huge assembly line and like sheep move, slowly
but surely toward the abattoir. There&rsquo;s just so much to do and so little
time. 24 hours are not enough to get everything done in one days&hellip; and
that is not including the things YOU really want to do. Everything is
timed. Your bathroom breaks are timed. No, there&rsquo;s nobody following me
with a stopwatch timing my every minute. The timing is actually done by
my own self&hellip; My (un)concious way of making sure I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;waste&rdquo; to
much time just sitting in the John. I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I
took a nice and long bath&hellip; Or the last time I just sat outside and
watched the sky at night&hellip; The little voice inside my head keeps
telling me: &ldquo;What??? <strong>Watch</strong> the sky??? Couldn&rsquo;t you do something
else, like folding your clothes or cooking enough food that will last 2
days so you don&rsquo;t have to cook after you get home at 7pm??? And don&rsquo;t
they have a DVD for those who like to watch the sky anyway???&rdquo; Maybe I
should litteraly unplug myself! It is one alternative I&rsquo;m yet to try&hellip;
Stop myself from trying to multitask every thing I do&hellip; Take the time
to completely focus on something that I enjoy doing 100%&hellip; like
fishing&hellip;</p>
