Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my Reading Challenge. I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time, read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much younger.</div>

This has become sort of a 'tradition' for me and because of it I have been able to learn about many interesting books, some of which I would not have found out on my own. I also 'blame' this activity to turning my nightstand into a mini-library on its own.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Background It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even during working hours, that eventually I sort of &quot;made a name for myself&quot; and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</div>

For someone who had spent most of their entire lives in a small and sleepy town in the East coast of Brazil, waking up and finding yourself at JFK Airport was nothing short of a major event!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Short on its heels, today I'm releasing FauxFactory 0.2.1 to fix a brown paper bag bug I encountered last night before going to bed.
Basically, the new &quot;Lorem Ipsum&quot; generator was not honoring the words parameter if you asked for a string longer than 70 characters. I have fixed the issue as well as added a new test to make sure that the generator does the right thing.
The package is available on Pypi (sadly the page is still not rendering correctly.</div>
