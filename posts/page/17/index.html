However, this is not yet another article about yet another Linux distribution with arguments about how great it is compared to other popular ones out there. No siree Bob! In fact, if you are happy with the platform or distribution that you are running, then kudos to you!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Over the holidays I got a second-hand Kindle DX from my sister. As I have been doing some serious reading these last couple of years, an EBook reader was something that both excited and scared me at the same time. Let me explain.
Being able to carry several books, often pretty thick and heavy, in one simple and light device has its advantages. Add to that the massive number of free EBooks and regular plain text books available on web sites such as the Internet Archive, Open Library, Project Gutenberg, and all of a sudden we&rsquo;re talking about having your own private and portable library on the go!</div>

During this period I tried many different approaches and techniques to both improve the user interface as well as the overall experience. Many of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; changes were performed only to satisfy my own curiosity and experimentation with other technologies out there, but overall you should have a good time playing with it.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Spent a good chunk of my free time reading all 9 (out of 10) parts of Lovelace and Babbage Vs The Organist this weekend! I don&rsquo;t know where to begin to describe how incredibly awesome this comic is! The graphics, the clever writing and jokes, even the sometimes absurd plot twists all combine for delivering a fantastic, fun reading experience!
I highly recommend that you read at least a few episodes and allow yourself to wander around the many links and tidbits about Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace, Quasiamicable Pair, musical instruments, math and many other items in the notes section!</div>
