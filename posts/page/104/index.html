                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Imagine yourself off on a bus going on a business trip at some far away place. This being a far away place, you eventually fall into a very heavy sleep and loose track of time and direction. Several hours later (or maybe even days?) you are awaken by someone who, speaking a different dialect seems to be telling you that the bus has reached its destination. Still a bit groggy from the sleep you shrug off this incident, grab your bag and step out of the bus and&hellip; To your surprise, you realize that the bus station seems somewhat odd and different from what you had expected&hellip; and when paying closer attention you also notice that every thing, people, stores signs, even trees, look different.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Yesterday, following the announcement that the folks behind the Opera web browser were giving away registration keys (the FREE part is implied) in celebration of their 10th anniversary, I too took the time to download a Linux version to see what the big deal was.
Opera is yet another web browser that is freely available for several different operating systems (Linux and Windows included) with a small caviat: The un-registered version has a toolbar-like banner displaying adds while you browse.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">While telling a co-worker how I managed to listen to my private *.ogg music files, I was asked if my music collection was &ldquo;legal?&rdquo; Having never spent much attention or time trying to understand what the music industry&rsquo;s peeve with music swappers, I started to think out loud what the answer should be to his question. The logic I used was as follows:
 All of my current music files were originally encoded from my own, store-bought CDs&hellip; I have pretty much gotten away with keeping the real CDs at home because [lengthy explanation followed here]&hellip; and decided to keep a digitized copy stored in one of my many external hard drives.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">My good friend from `The Land of the Rum &lt;http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=166&gt;`__ has spent the last 4-5 days attempting to install iWhax Linux onto him Windows XP laptop via VMWare 5. If I remember correctly, there weren&rsquo;t a lot of usefull information &ldquo;out there&rdquo; in the web and the few posts we (I also did some googling on the side for him) came across were either inacurate or not very newbie friendly. I remember that I borrowed his laptop this last Friday and tried some of the &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; but the automated installation script (don&rsquo;t remember the exact location in the iWhax menu) failed miserably every single attempt.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Been talking to someone from work quite extensive about Linux, Mono and C# these last 4 days. So much in fact that I looked back at my old pet project, Comic Buddy#. This had been a VB6 application I had written several years ago to allow me to browse all/any Calvin and Hobbes or Garfield comic strip that were (back then) freely available online. These comics, together with many others are still housed and fiercely maintained by a group (the company name and web site url left out on purpose) that has recently changed their policies concerning the viewing of said strips.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">During one of those lucid moments of spontaneous philosophical discussions I have with my wife while driving to work, I came up with the following question:
Assuming you follow Christianity&rsquo;s point of view about the creation of the world and human kind, you most likely know that God gave life to Adam and Eve, Earth&rsquo;s first inhabitants. They proceeded to follow his advice of propagating the race and gave birth to 3 kids (I believe they were all of masculine gender).</div>
