My daughter&rsquo;s daycare was closed today due to the weather. Eventhough there&rsquo;s less than 2 inches of snow on the ground they decided that it was safer not to open today. I think they just used a very lame excuse to have a day off and since they get paid no matter what, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt them in the pocket.
So today I brought my daughter to work with me for the first time.</div>

Every Wednesday night has been &ldquo;Enemy Territory Night&rdquo; for Vinny and I for quite some time now. I&rsquo;m a confessed E.T. addict and have been known for taking just any free second I can squeeze out of my tight daily agenda just so I can play a little bit. Tonight is the only time during the week when I can forego my house chores so I can solely concentrate on the game.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Today was my first day back to work since last Wednesday when I flew to Boston to attend Linux World Expo. It started out just like any other day: woke up early, drove daughter to daycare, crawled through traffic on the FDR Drive, parked across the street and coughed up the $11 daily rate, signed in at 8:25am, walked into my cubicle, said hello to my co-worker&hellip; Only there was no reply&hellip; there was nobody sitting there&hellip; in fact, the space previously taken by my Russian friend was empty!</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Because through out history, men have worn un-bifurcated garments.
Because if women had an appendage hanging between their legs we guarantee you they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be wearing pants.
Freedom, and increased mobility.
You only go around once, so why shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you be as comfortable as possible.
All men deserve air conditioning in the summer. You will chafe no more.
No more adjust, right side, left sideÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Say goodbye to wedgies.
A word about the pockets: Unlike pants, the UtilikiltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pockets are only sewn down on top, so that they move with the garment but not with your leg.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This last Friday was the second day of my trip to Boston. The agenda was very simple and yet had all the ingredients to an unforgetable day. Having swapped a few emails with Miguel De Icaza where I convinced him to meet me and give me a tour of Ximian&rsquo;s office in Cambridge, we had finally settled I&rsquo;d meet him during his lunch break. My friend Vinny and I left his house around 11am figuring it would take us about 30-40 minutes to get there but we were not counting on getting lost on the way.</div>
