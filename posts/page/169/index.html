                <div class="d-block text-truncate">On a previous post I had promised to comment on the movie Sideways. I finally managed to see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very pleased with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Thomas Haden Church (Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous adventures.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Jakub Steiner from Planet Gnome mentioned an old article written by Joel Spolsky on the importance of writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time to absorb his &ldquo;pearls of wisdom.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure all your snacks are within reach so you don&rsquo;t have to miss your favorite soap.</div>

I just had to post this one&hellip; Apparently Jim Caple, ESPN.com senior writer, took the time to explain why so many people hate the Yankees (I&rsquo;m actually a Yankees fan). Read an except from his latest book &quot;The Devil Wears Pinstripes.&quot;</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">My personal quest of gathering as much information as possible on the requirements to enroll into a PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill continued last Friday. I was up and early for my appointments at the Department of Computer Science considering I went to sleep really late the previous night. It was my sister&rsquo;s birthday so I took her out to the movies and a late dinner.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Arrived here in North Carolina last night at the Raleigh-Durham airport. My younger sister was waiting for me and as soon as we picked up my luggage we headed to her apartment in Chapel Hill. Woke up early today and went to my first (and only) meeting with the chair of the School of Information and Library Science at UNC. My sister had set up the meeting for me and I must admit I wasn&rsquo;t too sure if I wanted to spend the time to talk to someone from a department that had the word &ldquo;library&rdquo; in it.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">The day I fly to North Carolina has finally arrived. I&rsquo;m extremelly excited about this trip for it could be the kick in ass I need to get back on track with my goals. I&rsquo;ll be staying at my younger sister&rsquo;s apartment which I believe is near the UNC's Chapel Hill campus. She's already scheduled 4 interviews with the chairs of 4 different departments and I have just emailed her to try to get me 2 more.</div>
