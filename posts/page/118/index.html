 After reading about Musik Cube on two different places today I decided to give it a try. I downloaded it at work from one of the many mirrors and installed it in less than 1 minute. After the initial import process by which Musik Cube extracts and populates itself with the information from your media files, I was pleased with the simple and clean UI look.</div>

 After breaking (I&rsquo;m still clueless as for what really happened&hellip; Maybe I zapped it by wearing my fleece sweater) my SanDisk 1GB jump drive within 20 minutes of use last Wednesday, I finally drove back to CompUSA and picked up this little fella. It aboslutely rocks! I&rsquo;ve now installed Portable Firefox 1.0.1 and really like it. Today I want to take the time to sort most of my MP3s and load them in for a fun, music-filled day at work.</div>

I had to take Wednesday off from work so I could bring her to her doctor but it turned out to be a complete waste of time. He even performed an on-site strep throat test to see if that was the problem but the results were inconclusive.</div>

 Planet Debian Planet Security Planet Ubuntu  Some bloggers subscribe to multiple aggregators but you should have a lot of good material to read during your morning hours.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">It has been a long time since I last blogged on my other web site Linux Gnubbie. It was my first real &ldquo;taste&rdquo; of a real blown web site and up to the day I bought the domain I had relied on public (e.g. chock-full of banners and adds), free web site providers. Those really sucked specially because you were pretty much at the mercy of their regulations and forget about getting some type of remote access to work on your files.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">On a previous post I had promised to comment on the movie Sideways. I finally managed to see it while visiting my sister in North Carolina and was very pleased with the movie as a whole. The cast, the plot, the cinematography, the dialogues, everything contributed to a pleasant comedy-drama. Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Thomas Haden Church (Jack) take you on a roller coaster of emotions, making you ponder about your own choices in life as well as make you piss in your pants with their outrageous adventures.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Jakub Steiner from Planet Gnome mentioned an old article written by Joel Spolsky on the importance of writing software specifications before actually coding. It is a very light and interesting read and I strongly urge people to take the time to absorb his &ldquo;pearls of wisdom.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a programmer or just a couch potato. You may learn how to knock a lot of possible headaches out of the way, either by avoiding dealing with an angry user who wants a certain button shapped as a heart or making sure all your snacks are within reach so you don&rsquo;t have to miss your favorite soap.</div>

I just had to post this one&hellip; Apparently Jim Caple, ESPN.com senior writer, took the time to explain why so many people hate the Yankees (I&rsquo;m actually a Yankees fan). Read an except from his latest book &quot;The Devil Wears Pinstripes.&quot;</div>
