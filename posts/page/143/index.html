This past March I started a new routine to my Sunday mornings: shortly after breakfast with the kids, I flip my laptop open and start reading the Books section of the NY Times online. I wanted to get the real deal, dead tree &ldquo;version&rdquo; of it for quite some time, but at USD$6 just for the Sunday paper I figured that reading it online would have to do it.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">I wanted to comment on Tristan Rhodes's latest post before but didn&rsquo;t get a chance. Last time I checked he had received 56 comments on his suggestion to &ldquo;unify&rdquo; the Ubuntu name (and by unify he means to avoid the proliferation of several different distribution versions, that distinguish themselves based only on the window manager installed by default).
I must tell you that I have to agree with him, mainly because I feel that the many [U|X|Ku|n]buntu out there could be very confusing to an end user who&rsquo;s decided to check out GNU/Linux for the first time.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">My last post brought in a few interesting replies, the great majority of them showing support (somewhat) to the idea of unifying the Ubuntu name. While I let the caffeine surge do the talking toward the end of the post, I should have added the following statement to completely close my argument:
I&rsquo;m not suggesting that we stop manufacturing/shipping/distributing the other &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of Ubuntu in the form of CDs and downloads.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Imagine yourself off on a bus going on a business trip at some far away place. This being a far away place, you eventually fall into a very heavy sleep and loose track of time and direction. Several hours later (or maybe even days?) you are awaken by someone who, speaking a different dialect seems to be telling you that the bus has reached its destination. Still a bit groggy from the sleep you shrug off this incident, grab your bag and step out of the bus and&hellip; To your surprise, you realize that the bus station seems somewhat odd and different from what you had expected&hellip; and when paying closer attention you also notice that every thing, people, stores signs, even trees, look different.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">I started today using the new GNOME Display Manager, aka GDM. This new version (under development) was initially written before the GNOME 2.22 release but never made it on time for that release.
Some of new features are:
 Better fast-user-switching support (bug #343539 etc) Enable a smarter people chooser in the greeter Better ConsoleKit integration (seat awareness, coordination etc) Facilitate creating a new blingier greeter Dynamically configure displays Allow session agents to run in the greeter session (gnome-power-manager etc) Have the ability to only run a single greeter per seat (currently gdmflexiserver will start any number of them) Use PolicyKit for reboot etc authorization/handling Use a better configuration mechanism that is more compatible with a hypothetical systemwide D-Bus based GConf Provide a D-Bus API so that agents like fast-user-switch applet can be written more easily and operate more efficiently Fix all the horrible non-reentrant POSIX signal handling and various race conditions in the current code (bug #336549 etc) Make it easier to do &ldquo;hot desking&rdquo; type things Use a more modern design to simplify maintence and enhance flexibility (use of GObject etc) Use a more robust, secure, and flexible IPC  &hellip; and many more.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Been spending some quality hacking time these last few days, basically re-writting my tentative Rss reader application. The first 2 iterations relied on the Rss.NET code library but after hitting some major obstacles I sort of &ldquo;left it by the side of the road&rdquo; while I re-grouped my ideas. Last week I finally gathered enough ideas to go back to &ldquo;production.&rdquo; I decided to hack away at the Rss.NET library and turn it into a smaller, lean, and meaner piece of code.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Following up on a previous post, my good friend Steve Goguen has officially registered The Northern NJ Open Source Alliance. It will be an attempt to bring all the other &ldquo;geeky&rdquo; MeetUp groups from Northern New Jersey together into a an unified one. We should hear back soon from some of the other MeetUp organizers and work something out. I think the goal is to schedule all our individual meetings to coincide on the same dates.</div>
