Having just been swept off my feet by Billy, I decided to give it a try. I chose the &ldquo;Special&rdquo; download option and was very impressed with the extensive options for music file formats available. There&rsquo;s also a good amount of modules or plugins that can be downloaded from the web site. The interface is very simple and minimalistic, focusing almost that entirely on the task at hand: just playing your music files.</div>

I downloaded the setup file and chose my Pegasus as the destination folder. I then chose one of the several music folders I have inside Pegasus and started listening to my songs immediately. The program seems to have been written for those of us who hate using the mouse and rather use keyboard shortcuts.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Recently MeetUp, a then free group organizing web service, has decided to charge registered groups for its services. A Meetup meeting organizer must now pay $19 a month to use their software. Having spent the last 8-9 months as the organizer for the Northern NJ Linux Meetup I&rsquo;m somewhat saddened by the fact that this move will most definitely mean the end of the group. Averaging 3 members for ever meeting we&rsquo;ve had so far (with the exception of the day I brought someone from Ubuntu Linux to gives us a talk&hellip; that day we had 7 members!</div>

 &quot;But the best thing was the chef Nat had hired for the week, who cooked delicious crepes every morning. He even cooked, after seeing there was a Spanish guy in the crowd, some Spanish omelettes.&quot;
 Once again I have solid proof that there are better ways of &ldquo;team building&rdquo; than what I&rsquo;ve experienced so far in my short career as a developer. It used to be that the IT group of any organization ruled, getting a lot of respect and perks along the way.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Ever since MeetUp announced they would start charging groups money to use their free service, I started thinking of possible alternatives to keep the Northern NJ Linux Meetup group alive. I understand that everyone is entitled to make a living but I don&rsquo;t agree with their decision of making this drastic change of heart without any warnings. I have spoken to some people and read some posts/comments online and came to the conclusion that the smaller groups will most likely vanish in the turmoil.</div>

Been churning out code for my very simple data to xml application and sometimes (the horror) I don&rsquo;t even want to go home so I won&rsquo;t interrupt the grooviness! Tomorrow I&rsquo;m scheduled to give a live demo to the rest of the group! I&rsquo;m ready to blow them off their socks! For such a simple and small program, I think I&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job at making it usefull and stable!</div>
