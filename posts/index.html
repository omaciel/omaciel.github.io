                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This past July of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, I managed to finally get started on a project that had been shelved for a while: write my second book.
From July 13th to the middle of August, I wrote fevereshly every day, working on what became &ldquo;I.C.Q.,&quot; my very first piece of fiction, which you can pre-order right now.
&ldquo;Auggie Benson is a high school senior boy who freelances as a software developer and hacker after school to improve his skills and make some money on the side.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love being a Quality Engineer, something that I have been doing for a living for the last 11 years of my life! During these 11 years, I have had the pleasure (yes, pleasure!) of being tossed around, torn to pieces and thrown at a lot of scary and difficult situations in the world of software testing!
Armed only with a strong desire to learn and excel at my profession, I have seen, heard and gone through a multitude of experiences, challenges, and opportunities.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">It was June 8th,1974 and on a warm evening in the territory of Amapá, now a state in the northern part of Brazil, a baby boy was born. Other than being a couple of months premature, the one thing that made this birth a bit more interesting than any premature birth was the fact that this baby had its hands and feet completely bent inwards, almost fused into his arms and legs.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">The last time I wrote about Quality Engineering, I mentioned that some of the reasons why people are not familiar with this term are, in no particular order:
 'Quality' is usually something that is added as an after thought and doesn't really come into the picture, if ever, until the very end of the release process Nobody outside of a QA team really knows what they do. It has something to do with testing.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">Whenever I meet someone for the first time, after we get past the initial niceties typically involved when you meet someone for the first time, eventually the conversation shifts to work and what one does for a living. Inevitably I'm faced with what, at a first glance, may sound like a simple question and the conversation goes like this:
 New acquaintance: &quot;What do you do at Red Hat?&quot; Me: &quot;I manage a team of quality engineers for a couple of different products.</div>

                <div class="d-block text-truncate">This week I started reading On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft by Stephen King, a book that has been mentioned a few times by people I usually interview for my weekly podcast as something that is both inspiring and has had a major impact on their lives and careers. After the third or forth time someone mentioned I finally broke down and got myself a copy at the local bookstore.</div>
