            <article><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am definitely not a show off and am only posting this
here so I can always look back and remember the responsibility I have
voluntarily accepted upon me: To be an Ubuntu Member!</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is the report of todays Community Council Meeting</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Items</strong></li>
<li>Bhuvan suggested that the RSS feed of the wiki RecentChanges page
should be advertized more. This is going to happen.</li>
<li>The options for reducing the stress on the CC meetings by
(partially) delegating membership approvals have been discussed.
There was general consensus that Option C of the plans of Mark
Shuttleworth is the best way forward. This will be implemented as
soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>LoCo Teams</strong></li>
<li>The Japanese locoteam introduced itself, Jun Kobayashi and Hiroyuki
Ikezoe reported their plans and their achievements. The main
achievement is a localized version of the Ubuntu CD. Their good work
will be merged with Ubuntu to make Ubuntu rock Japan.</li>
<li><strong>New Community Members</strong></li>
<li>After months of waiting and not being able to attend the meetings,
Jonathan Jesse and Robert Stoffers have joined the Ubuntu community.
Their work for the documentation team has been absolutely teriffic.</li>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The emphasis is all mine&hellip; ;)</li>
<li>It was stated that I created Planeta Ubuntu Brasil. Even though I
did come up with the idea and got the project going, it was only due
to the collaborative effort of a few Brazilian users that the web
site came to be! I am very proud of what we have accomplished
together and could never take credit for the entire enterprise! I
have contacted the author of the <a href="http://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2005-November/012877.html">original
post</a>
and asked him to make the proper changes!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It has been fixed&hellip;</p>
<p>[snip]&ldquo;Seems like I messed up my logs here. Og Maciel and Mario Meyer
have both done good work in the Brazil team, both have been welcomed
aboard the Ubuntu ship. Mario Meyer is the person who wrote PHPlanet,
which powers the brasilian planet.&quot;[/snip]</p>
