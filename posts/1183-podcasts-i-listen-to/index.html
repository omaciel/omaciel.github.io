            <article><p><img src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/podcast-image.jpg" alt="Podcasts"></p>
<p>For someone who has run his own <a href="http://castalio.info/">podcast</a> for
several years (albeit not generating a lot of content lately), it took
me quite some time to actually start <em>listening</em> to podcasts myself.
Ironic, I know, but I guess the main reason behind this was because I
was always reading code at work and eventually, no matter how hard I
tried, I just couldn't pay attention to what was being said! No matter
how interesting the topic being discussed was or how engaging the hosts
(or hosts) were, my brain would be so focused on reading code that
everything else just turned into white noise.</p>
<p>Well, fast forward a couple of years and I still am reading code (though
not as much as I used to due to a new role), and I still have a hard
time listening to podcast while at work... so I decided to only listen
to them when I was <strong>not</strong> working. Simple, right? But it took me a
while to change that for some reason.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I now listen to podcasts while driving (which I don't really do
a lot of since I work from home 99.99% of the time) or when I go for
walks, and after a while I have started following a handful of them
which are now part of my weekly routine:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/allthebooks">All The Books</a> which
provide me with an up to date list of suggestions for what books to
read next. They're pretty regular with their episodes, so I can
always count on listening about new books pretty much every week.</li>
<li><a href="http://bookriot.com/listen/shows/thepodcast">Book Riot</a> for another
dose of more news about books!</li>
<li><a href="http://hacktheentrepreneur.com/">Hack the Entrepreneur</a> to keep up
with people who are making something about what they are passionate
about.</li>
<li><a href="https://howwegettonext.com/tagged/wonderland-podcast">Wonderland
Podcast</a> which
I only started listening to a few weeks back but it has turned into
one of my favorite.</li>
<li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/science-vs">Science Vs</a> another new addition
to my list, with entertaining takes at interesting topics such as
'the G-spot', 'Fracking', 'Gun Control' and 'Organic Food'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today I was introduced to
<a href="http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia">Invisibilia</a> and though
I only listened to the first 10 minutes (I was giving the link during
working hours, so no go for me), I'm already very interested and will
follow it.</p>
<p>I do have other podcasts that I am still subscribed to, but these listed
here are the ones that I am still following every episode. Maybe if I
had to drive to work every day or went for walks more often, maybe then
I would listen to more podcasts? Trust me though, I rather continue
listening to only a small set of them than drive to work every day.
Don't get me wrong, I <strong>love</strong> going to work, but that's 2 hours/day
of my life that I rather spend at home :)</p>
<p>How about you? What podcasts do you find yourself going back to every
time a new episode is published? Would you mind sharing your suggestions
(and why you like the podcasts) with me here?</p>
