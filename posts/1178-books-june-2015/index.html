        <article>
          <p><img src="https://omaciel.fedorapeople.org/book_review.png" alt="">{.align-left}</p>
<p>Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend
most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could
say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years
after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for
spending most of my time trying to learn about <strong>Linux</strong>, get an
education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided
that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I
'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading <strong>for
fun</strong> every day.</p>
<p>I find it funny to say that I had to <strong>force</strong> myself, but this
statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time
sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information
every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails,
RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing
nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking
and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting
quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk
and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place
somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally
got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to
these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized
that if I skipped this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they
got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of
the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for
relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!</p>
<p>Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and
with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am
today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into
the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an
important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=John+Steinbeck">John
Steinbeck</a>,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray
Bradbury</a>
and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated <strong>The Grapes of
Wrath</strong> when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years
to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate
this amazing piece of art!</p>
<p>These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the
books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading
progress on
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel">GoodReads</a> and
add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for
reading or buying them. Those familiar with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Nick+Hornby">Nick
Hornby</a>
will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely
come) with the work he has done writing for the <a href="http://www.believermag.com/">Believer
Magazine</a> ... and this would be correct.
My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I
thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading
'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get
across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it
works for me :)</p>
<p>Since June was a very busy book buying/getting month for me (mostly
because it was my birthday and I used that as an excuse to go overboard
and get lots of books), here is my summary for everything that happened
on the reading front. By the way, if you want to get me a book from my
<strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="http://amzn.com/w/32BX7VP2GEFI1">Wish List</a>, by all means,
do so :)</p>

<p>Compared to last month (and I did write a post about it, but only in
Portuguese), it may look like I didn't get a lot of reading done in
June, but that is not quite true. Further down you'll see that I've
been reading a pretty thick book with around 910 pages <strong>and</strong>, as
usual, I am also reading several books at the same time... and did not
finish them before the end of the month.</p>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Open+Organization">The Open
Organization</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Jim+Whitehurst">Jim
Whitehurst</a>,
current CEO for <strong>Red Hat</strong> (where I work since 2011), I got when the
book was launched a few weeks ago. The reason why I chose to put it at
the top of my reading list had nothing to do with the fact that it was
written by my boss' boss :) but mostly because it talked about certain
topics which are very close to my personal interests. The topics
discussed are not necessarily new to me, but they are part of my
day-to-day routine and I get to practice a lot of them every day. The
concept of <strong>meritocracy</strong> is embedded into the DNA of everyone who
works at <strong>Red Hat</strong> and it was very interesting to see how this culture
affected and shaped <strong>Jim Whitehurst</strong>'s career when he joined this
company after joining us from <strong>Delta</strong>. The cultural shock through
which he went through reminded me of a similar experience I had when I
moved to North Carolina and joined <strong>rPath</strong>. Many of the names cited
throughout the book are people that I have met and worked with in the
past almost 4 years, which lent to the reading experience a feeling of
closeness and being part of a bigger entity.</p>

was recommended by my wife, and since I had already read other stories
by <strong>Flannery O'Connor</strong> (and was deeply impressed with the very story
I read, <strong>A Good Man is Hard to Find</strong>) I figured that it was a good
opportunity to read a bit more of her stories. As in most of the her
previous work (that I read), there is a very strong theme around
religion present that permeates and affects, not always in a positive
manner, her characters. The scenery and characters are also based in the
southern region of the United States, and it's really amazing how well
she manages to capture the essence of the south! Unfortunately I felt
that the book's plot didn't always make a lot of sense, oftentimes
with events that did not seem to add anything to the main story and
characters that simply disappeared from the book without a trace or
impact on the story itself. It was only after I took some time to
research a bit that I learned that this book seems to have been made by
several other stories that the author wrote earlier in her career, and
were &quot;hammered&quot; together to create a book. Anyway, I recommend this
writer if you haven't already read her, and I strongly recommend <strong>A
Good Man is Hard to Find</strong> for being very &quot;dark&quot; and a perfect example
of her style!</p>

<p>To be honest, I barely touched in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes</a>
this month, especially since, as I said in a previous article, I was not
impressed with the stories and found them to be mostly super dull.
Let's see if I will finish it ...</p>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Fluent+Python">Fluent

was another that I barely opened, but for much different reasons. The
problem was finding free time to read a technical book, after spending
the entire month solving problems at work. All my spare time was spent
reading things that relaxed me and I made a great effort to disconnect
myself from any issues that were related to work. But the book is great
and I'll finish it for sure!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a>
is the book that I mentioned before to be huge (910 pages in the edition
I have) and has taken much of my reading time. I usually read it at
night and before going to bed. The story is very interesting and it is
easy to see why so many people suggest it for those who love science
fiction. Mixing a little history of <strong>World War II</strong>, with characters
from real life, and technologies that are part of our life today, I have
read this book slowly, enjoying each chapter and revelations. I'm
almost on page 600 :)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=S">S</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=J.+J.+Abrams">J. J.
Abrams</a>
has been the most difficult book to read! Not that it is annoying (as
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes</a>)
but it requires a lot of time and &quot;work&quot; to read it. Let me explain.
The book has a very interesting story about a person who one day finds
himself in a completely strange place... with his clothes soaked with
seawater ... and with amnesia! But throughout the book, the margins of
the pages are completely filled with comments and handwritten messages
(pen, pencil, etc.). When you start reading these messages, you discover
that two complete strangers (both for us, the readers, but also among
themselves) began communicating casually leaving 'messages' on the
margins of this book, which they borrow and return to the local library
every time they want to get a response from the other. As you start
reading these scribbled messages you then discover that the story
described in the book may be a coded message to explain the strange life
and eventual disappearance of its author. Roughly at every 10 pages you
find loose notes purported to have been left by the two people who are
communicating in the margins of the book, copies of documents, letters
or newspapers that serve as clues and evidence that were found by them
trying to unravel the mystery. For each page that you read from the book
itself, you spend almost as much time reading the comments and loose
papers. Super cool but a lot of work to read ;)</p>
