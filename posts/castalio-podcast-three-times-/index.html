<p>The idea of doing a <strong>podcast</strong> is something that has tickled my
[STRIKEOUT:curiosity] fancy for quite some time. As a matter of fact,
I am already the <strong>survivor</strong> of 2 other mildly successful attempts,
which sadly, died prematurely due to commitment issues from my partners
and my inability to record and edit audio using Linux.</p>
<p>About 6 months ago the need to scratch this itch came back in full
power, and thanks to the support of my friend <strong>Evandro Pastor</strong>,
<a href="http://www.castalio.info/">Castálio Podcast</a> was born! Instead of
getting together with a couple of friends and discussing about
technology and current events, I wanted to do something a bit more
different and avoid the typical routine by turning it into a talk
show-like interview program. Every other week I&rsquo;d invite someone from
the <strong>Brazilian</strong> Free and Open Source world and have a chat about their
childhood, upbringing, and the tv shows, movies, books and music that
shaped them into who they are now. To quote my good friend <strong>Kurt</strong>, it
would be &ldquo;<em>the equivalent to opening a friend&rsquo;s MP3 collection and
seeing what that person was like</em>&rdquo;! :)</p>
<p>Shortly after we recorded our second or third episode, Evandro who not
only served as the host (while I chatted with our guest) but also
recorded and edited the audio, had a severe case of <strong>tendinitis</strong> and
was not able to participate anymore. Once again I was faced with the old
dilema of not having anyone else to run a podcast or to record and edit
it&hellip; but this time I didn&rsquo;t want to see another attempt of creating a
podcast die a premature death&hellip; I had too much vested already on it!</p>
<p>So for the last 6 months I&rsquo;ve been interviewing, editing, publishing and
maintaining the podcast during my free time and having a blast! So far
all of my guests are Brazilians and the podcast itself caters for the
Brazilian and/or Hispanic audience, but an episode in English is in the
works for the very near future. Through the 12 episodes I&rsquo;ve recorded so
far I had a chance to chat with some really interesting, fun and
exciting people, such as <a href="http://igorsoares.com/">Igor Soares</a> (<strong>Fedora
Embassador</strong>), <a href="http://lucasr.org/blog/">Lucas Rocha</a> (<strong>GNOME</strong> and new
<strong>Mozillian</strong>), <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/johan/">Johan Dahlin</a>
(<strong>Stoq</strong>), <a href="http://diegobz.net/">Diego Zacarão</a> (<strong>Transifex</strong>) and
many others who totally opened up themselves to me (and our followers).
I learned a lot from these chats and was inspired by their stories of
success, failure, innovation and adventures!</p>
<p>Did you know that <strong>Johan</strong> is a <strong>Swede</strong> but lives in Brazil and
speaks fluent Brazilian Portuguese? That <strong>Lucas</strong> used to be part of
a <strong>Guns and Roses</strong>, <strong>Metallica</strong>, <strong>Iron
Maiden</strong> and *<em>Nirvana</em>* cover band when he was only <strong>13-years-old</strong>?
During the many hours spent talking to my guests I learned about their
likes and dislikes, what books and music they enjoy, and indirectly
became more acquainted with the real person behind the IRC nick/email
address!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really glad I decided to continue with this project and didn&rsquo;t give
up early on. You&rsquo;ll be glad to know that Evandro is recovering from his
tendinitis and may be able to drop by one of these days. The next 2
episodes are already recorded and more guests are scheduled to talk
about their passions and projects on different topics, including
<strong>arduino</strong> and writing books! If you know someone whom you&rsquo;d like to
learn a bit more about their story, drop me a line or a comment and
hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to schedule something.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to the next 6 months!</p>
