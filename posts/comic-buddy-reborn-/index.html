                </p>

            
            <article><p>Been talking to someone from work quite extensive about Linux, Mono and
C# these last 4 days. So much in fact that I looked back at my old pet
project, Comic Buddy#. This had been a VB6 application I had written
several years ago to allow me to browse all/any Calvin and Hobbes or
Garfield comic strip that were (back then) freely available online.
These comics, together with many others are still housed and fiercely
maintained by a group (the company name and web site url left out on
purpose) that has recently changed their policies concerning the viewing
of said strips.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the application built a dynamic string
pointing directly to the comic&rsquo;s url and displayed it onto a web browser
control embedded in the application. The program itself was freely
distributed at several locations, including downloads.com, and reached
25,000 downloads at one time. Feeling that a lot of people could take
advantage of this program, I then naively contacted said group and
offered to give them the rights to distribute it on their web site, free
of charge. I did receive a reply stating they were very interested and
had a few suggestions for possible enhancements, to which I agreed.
However, shortly after that email, I received another one where they
politely refused my offer and told me they had decided to develop
something similar in-house. I didn&rsquo;t think much of it afterward until I
received a legal &ldquo;cease and desist&rdquo; email from the group&rsquo;s lawyers. I
promptly contacted them and tried to defend me from the accusations that
I was distributing copyrighted material. I tried in vain to explain to
the guy on the phone that the application worked as a web browser and
nothing was being distributed&hellip; That very same day Comic Buddy was
removed and never seen again (those there are some places out there in
the wild www where you can still manage to get a broken copy of the
installer).</p>
<p>Talking to this person from work made me go back to sourceforge.net and
download the source code for my failed attempt at porting Comic Buddy to
C# (and Linux). Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of Comic Buddy# at a very
rudimentary stage. Maybe this is the inspiration to go back to coding
that I needed?</p>
