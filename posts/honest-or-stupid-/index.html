                </p>

            
            <article><p>Today I went for a job interview for a company about 35 miles West of
where I live. The interview was scheduled for 10am and I was to meet the
recruiter outside the building 15 minutes before the scheduled 2 hour
ordeal. It took me about 30 minutes to get there and for the next 15
minutes the sales rep gave me a pep talk about the company and position.</p>
<p>The first person to interview me was the company&rsquo;s Lead Project Manager
who spend the next 30 minutes asking me questions about hypothetical
situations where I was the project manager and had to deal with certain
situations. Now mind you I have never actually managed anyone in my life
besides a small stint where I had to work with a temp and pretty much
spoon feed him the information he needed in order to help me with my
project. At the end of those 30 minutes I felt a bit drained (for all of
my answers were based on what I thought would be the right answer and
not real experience) but confident I had made a good impression.</p>
<p>I was then interviewed by another guy, who was supposed to ask me the
&ldquo;technical stuff.&rdquo; I actually did most of the talking, primarely telling
him about my previous jobs and my involvement with Linux. I thought it
went pretty well and soon he was up and out of the office. Right before
the next interviewer walked into the room, I heard the previous guy
talking to someone, as if he was already giving his feedback on the
interview to someone over the phone. I wasn&rsquo;t able to pick up every word
he said but it went roughly like this: &ldquo;Yeah&hellip; [inaudible] has some
VB, Oracle, [inaudible] Linux&hellip; but [inaudible] not [inaudible]
senior material&hellip; [inaudible]&rdquo;&hellip; and in comes the next interviewer.</p>
<p>That got me thinking and I realized I didn&rsquo;t really know what position I
was being interviewed for and only had a list of requirements. As soon
as the next interviewer introduced himself as &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; I decided to
cut to the chase and ask him about the position before he could even ask
me any questions. It turns out the position was for a Senior Level
Project Manager with LOTS of experience doing software engineering, etc.
I immediately realized I was interviewing for a position I was 100% not
qualified for and decided that it would be best if I came out and told
&ldquo;the boss&rdquo; about it. &ldquo;I am not qualified for this position and I think
I&rsquo;ve been sent to the wrong interview,&rdquo; I told him. He was dumbstruck!
&ldquo;I have NEVER met someone as honest as you are!&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I wish
more people were as honest as you are! If I had a Junior Level openning
available I&rsquo;d hire you RIGHT NOW!&rdquo; He seemed to be genuine when he said
that. I thanked him for his time and he profusely apologized for not
being able to offer me a position.</p>
<p>I walked back to my car and drove another 2.5 hours back to work so I
could register 3 hours worked on my timesheet!</p>
