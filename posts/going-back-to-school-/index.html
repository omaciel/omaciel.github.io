            <article><p>I can finally talk about my great news: <strong>I&rsquo;m going back to school this
Fall</strong>! Everyone who knows me well knows how much I&rsquo;ve wanted to be a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Tar_Heels">Tar Heel</a>! There
is something about the University of North Carolina and Chapel Hill that
makes me feel like this is where I belong. From the very first time I
came here I fell in love with the place, people and places and I knew
right there and then that one day I&rsquo;d be calling it home some day.</p>
<p>In March of 2005 I made my first exploratory trip from New Jersey,
setting up interviews with several departments to find out what would
take for me to go back to school and pursue a higher education (I
currently hold a BS in Biochemistry from Pace University). Had a great
meeting with Dr. Blake (I blogged about it
<a href="https://omaciel.github.io/tar-heel-dreaming.html">here</a>) and started my
plan to move my family to North Carolina. Back then there were only 3 of
us&hellip;</p>
<p>Fast forward 3 years&hellip; Chapel Hill has been my home for almost 2 years
now! In April I was approved into the Continuing Education program and
once again set up a meeting with Dr. Blake. The same electricity was in
the air! I convinced myself that I should start taking some classes to
get back in the swing of things, and with Dr. Blake&rsquo;s permission I
signed up for a grad level class in database design. My entire family
was very supportive and has rallied behind me to get me the money to pay
for the class (3 credits). Today I finally got the green light from my
job to work remotely twice a week so I can attend the class!</p>
<p>This is all very exciting to me and I am really looking forward to my
first day in class and interacting with people who really enjoy
technology! Sure I have worked with databases for most of my
professional career but I got the feeling this class will help me become
a better designer&hellip; and it will be my first step toward a bigger goal!</p>
