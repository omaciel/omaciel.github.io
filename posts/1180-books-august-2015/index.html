<p>This <strong>August 2015</strong> I took a break from work and spent about 6 days
enjoying some R&amp;R down the North Carolina shore with my family. I
managed to get through some of the books that were waiting for a long
time for me to get to them, as well as try some new authors.</p>
<h1 id="read">Read</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Sentinel">The
Sentinel</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Arthur+C.+Clarke">Arthur C.
Clarke</a></p>
<p>I forgot where I read about how the short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot; was
the inspiration for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, but being that I have
always considered the latter a great book and movie, I managed to
grab a copy of the anthology &quot;The Sentinel&quot; just so that I could
read the short story by the same name and see what else Arthur C.
Clarke &quot;had to offer.&quot; Interestingly enough (to me), most if not
all the other short stories included in this collection could easily
be published today and still feel just as futuristic as they
probably were back when they were first published! This was yet
another one of the books that I read by the beach this Summer and
though it didn't blow me away, it was still a very relaxing read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=A+Princess+of+Mars">A Princess of
Mars</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Edgar+Rice+Burroughs">Edgar Rice
Burroughs</a></p>
<p>This last June I got from my family for my birthday &quot;John Carter of
Mars&quot; containing the complete series and I was just itching for a
good opportunity to start reading it. That chance came up this week
as I started reading some of Melville's short stories and found
that I needed a bit of a &quot;break&quot;. First off, I have never read
Edgar Rice Burroughs before but I do have a copy of &quot;Tarzan of the
Apes&quot; also awaiting for a chance, so I had an idea about what to
expect from his style. Sure enough, reading &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot;
felt like a taking a trip down memory's lane, back when it was easy
to tell who the good and the bad guys were, and there was always a
damsel in distress somewhere waiting to be rescued. I have to
confess that it took me a few chapters to get re-acclimated with
this style, but once I got into it, it was easy reading, which is
exactly what I was looking for any how.</p>
<p>John Carter, the main character, shows all the expected, clich√©
virtues one would expect from a &quot;hero&quot; but one thing that bothered
me a bit was the language he used to describe those who were
different from him (which was mostly everyone in the story, since
they were all Martians) and the way he treated them. It felt a bit
abusive and even a but racist? I don't know if someone could get
away with writing in the same style today, but then again I
remembered that back then people were not as politically correct as
we are today... or maybe I was reading too much into it? Anyhow, it
was a fun read and I think I will try to add the next 4 books of the
series in the coming months so that I can hopefully get a better
opinion formed about the author.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Vidas+Secas">Vidas
Secas</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Graciliano+Ramos">Graciliano
Ramos</a></p>
<p>My first time reading Graciliano Ramos but I knew about this book
from other folks who read it growing up for school. This is the
story about how Fabiano, Vitoria, their two small children,
&quot;baleia&quot; (whale) the dog and a parrot find themselves fighting for
their lives (the parrot is not so lucky and quickly becomes dinner
before the end of the first chapter) as they wonder one of the most
desolate and arid regions of Brazil, in search for a job and a
chance for survival. The characters are presented one by one, as the
author allows us a glimpse of their lives and most inner thoughts
(or lack of) as if seen from their own eyes. Their lack of
communication skills (they mostly understand each other through
grunts and gestures), poverty (all Vitoria wants is a bed that
doesn't have a wood slat with a big knot in the middle which forces
her to sleep sideways and in a fetal position) and failed ambitions
as well as how fragile and dependent on the weather (no rain means
no water for the farm animals and therefore no job security for
Fabiano) their lives are reminded me a lot of &quot;The Grapes of
Wrath.&quot;</p>
<p>This book is a window into what it was like to be poor in the
Northeastern region of Brazil at the turn of last century and I
wonder how much of it may still be true nowadays?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cannery+Row">Cannery
Row</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=John+Steinbeck">John
Steinbeck</a></p>
<p>Another great book by the master! I read this book while enjoying a
much needed vacation with my family, and I couldn't have chosen a
better book. Though the plot itself may look a bit too simple at a
glance to interest anyone who is not familiar with Steinbeck, he
more than makes up for it by providing a nice list of colorful
characters, places (a whorehouse named &quot;Bear Flag Restaurant&quot; and
&quot;The Palace Flophouse&quot; where Mac and possibly leader of a small
group of vagrants) and events that take place along &quot;cannery row&quot;,
a street lined with shabby stores that mostly cater to those who
work and earn their living from the many sardine canneries in the
area.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed reading about each one of the characters and
how Stenibeck, masterfully as always, brings them all together in a
party to end all parties! I was often reminded of another one of his
books, &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, which I also strongly recommend.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Neil+Gaiman">Neil
Gaiman</a></p>
<p>I never read &quot;Neverwhere&quot; the first time it was published in the
late 1990s and had zero knowledge about its plot, so I had the
advantage of reading this &quot;for the first time&quot; while sipping
drinks by the North Carolina coast :) This story has a bit of
everything: angels, demons, wild beasts, hunters, warriors, talking
mice and a common Londoner named Richard Mayhew, who find himself
the unwilling rescuer and then adventure partner of Door (yes, that
is her name), the remaining member of a family from Neverwhere. To
go back to his old life, he must help Door escape from two
demoniacal assassins and find out the truth about the murder of her
family. Entertaining and, in my humble opinion, another good example
of why Neil Gaiman deserves a spot amongst the best sci-fi writers
ever.</p>

<p><a href="">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\: An Inquiry Into
Values</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Robert+M.+Pirsig">Robert M.
Pirsig</a></p>
<p>It was with a bit of trepidation that I started this book, being
that there was a lot of hype about it and the assumptions I had made
from this hype and what the 'Zen' part of its title implied. My
concern being that I didn't want to set myself for disappointment
if the book didn't live up to the (very) high expectations I had. I
must say, this book is very dense and it was not an easy read...
for me at least. Intermingled with the story of the father-son duo
traveling through several states on their way West, there are many
inner monologues where we learn A LOT about ancient philosophy and
how the relentless pursuit of understanding Quality and Truth by the
father affected his life and those around him. I had to make a point
of finding a quiet place AND a quiet time to read this book just in
order to keep up with it.</p>
<p>I think that to categorize this book and give it a &quot;grade&quot; without
the benefit of having enough time to thoroughly &quot;digest&quot; it is a
nearly impossible task to achieve, but the one thing I can say is
that I feel that I learned a lot more about philosophy than I
thought I was able to, mostly because of the way ideas and terms
were described by the author. I also enjoyed how the relationship
between father and son was developed and how it all came together in
the end, by which time I was reading as fast as I could, barely able
to contain my curiosity!</p>
<p>Is &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; for the 'faint of
heart'? Probably not. I think that the analogy where wines get
better with age is applicable here, where you, the reader, is the
'wine' and you must be at a later time in your life to truly be
able to grasp what this book is all about. I may be giving it
another go later on just to see what other things I may find, once I
give myself enough time to (hopefully) grow wiser and have more
'miles' to show for. :)</p>

<p><a href="">The Lottery\: And Other Stories</a> by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Shirley+Jackson">Shirley
Jackson</a></p>
<p>There were two main reasons why I decided to read this book: 1) I
read &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; this month and was
moderately interested in Shirley Jackson's style, and 2) I heard
about the story &quot;The Lottery&quot; from my wife, which only helped peak
my curiosity. So I borrowed the book from the public library and
went straight to &quot;The Lottery&quot;, which happens to be the very last
story in the book. This story gave me, once again, a good taste for
her ability to describe places, characters, and what may seem at
fist a very mundane scene and... WHAMMO, hit you with a plot twist
that catches you unaware and gasping for air. &quot;This book should be
a thrilling roller-coaster ride,&quot; I thought.</p>
<p>Well, to be honest I felt that &quot;The Lottery&quot; was by far the
darkest of the whole lot. The rest of the other stories, for the
most part, were very well thought out, organized and with a plot
twist in the end, but the surprises were of a different type: they
leave you wondering if you missed something and the questions &quot;what
just happened here?&quot; and &quot;huh???&quot; were frequently uttered by
yours truly as I read the entire book. Most stories do show a hint
of weirdness and sometimes the creepiness is very subtle... but
just when you think you know where you're headed and you find
yourself bracing for the end, she blindfolds you, spins you around
10 times and leaves you in a totally different place, time and with
a strange taste in your mouth.</p>
<p>You may think that after all this I would now proclaim that I would
never touch one of her stories... but to be honest, I find that
I'm even more interested to learn about this author and this style
of hers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=We+Have+Always+Lived+in+the+Castle">We Have Always Lived in the
Castle</a>
by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Shirley+Jackson">Shirley
Jackson</a></p>
<p>This was my first Shirley Jackson book and I was a bit confused
about her style and if this was perhaps a precursor to what we now
call Young Fiction? I think what really threw me off a bit was the
'child-like' language used between Mary Katherine &quot;Merricat&quot;
Blackwood and Constance, the two sisters who are the main
protagonists in this story, and how it contrasted with the plot
itself. Since this book was published in the early 1960s and touches
on the topic of human persecution usually experienced when people
find you to be &quot;different than the norm&quot;, the dialogues between
&quot;Merricat&quot; and the other characters made it all sound like she was
a younger girl than she really was (she's supposed to be
18-years-old if I'm not mistaken). There's also a string touch of
what I am going to loosely call &quot;weird fiction&quot;, as for instance
when she keeps talking to her pet cat as if it were a real person
capable of not only understanding her but also making intelligent
comments and replies that only she could hear. Or how, despite all
the weird things going around them and how they live completely
isolated from everyone, everyone in the Blackwood household goes on
about their day as if everything was normal.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I think what really captivated me about this book (and made
me go back for more later on) was, funny enough, this mix of dark
and weird and I think I also got my first glimpse at the way most of
Shirley Jackson's stories end, hanging you out there and wondering
&quot;WTF?&quot; :)</p>
