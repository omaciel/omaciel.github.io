<p>Shortly after I finished reading &ldquo;<strong>The Hunger Games</strong>&quot; (here&rsquo;s my
<a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1278">review</a> in case you&rsquo;ve missed it) I
decided to move on to the second book of the trilogy to see if this
popular <strong>Young Fiction</strong> could get me excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Catching-Fire-Second-Hunger-Games/dp/0439023491/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295318165&amp;sr=8-1">Catching
Fire</a>&quot;
is the so called &quot;informational&quot; segment of any trilogy where the
author sheds some more light into the main characters' history and
insights as to what led them to make certain decisions.</p>
<p>The book starts off fairly slowly with <strong>Katniss</strong> and <strong>Peeta</strong>
returning home to D<strong>istrict 12</strong> after having just outsmarted the
designers of the Hunger Games. But they were mistaken to think that they
could just go back to their normal lives, as their final act was viewed
by many as an act of defiance,  and Katniss unwittingly becomes the
symbol of rebellion for the other districts.</p>
<p>Though they get to move to a new house in a much nicer neighborhood,
plenty of food and amenities, as the current victors they have to go on
tour across all of the remaining districts to serve as a reminder to
others that the Capitol is very much in control of their lives.</p>
<p>As Katniss struggles to understand her real feelings for <strong>Gale</strong> and
Peeta, she is one day surprised by a visit from <strong>President</strong> <strong>Snow</strong>
who stops by to let her know that the Capitol has not taken lightly her
actions and that there will be consequences if she doesn&rsquo;t perform well
during the tour. Her instructions are very clear: quiet down all talks
and ill feelings from the districts toward the Capitol or suffer the
consequences!</p>
<p>The tour ends up causing more harm to her already precarious situation
and by the time Katniss and Peeta are back home the damage is already
done. But the Capitol doesn&rsquo;t take too long to react and comes back with
another twisted plan: A &ldquo;commemorative edition&rdquo; of the Hunger Games
where all of the still living previous victors are &ldquo;invited&rdquo; back to
compete against each other.</p>
<p>Once again Katniss and Peeta have to compete for their lives against a
much more mature and experienced crowd. Alliances and enemies are formed
and broken up at a fairly fast rate and it gets harder and harder to
figure out who is really helping whom.</p>
<p>I must admit that the traps are more intriguing this time and the closer
you get to the end of the book, the harder it is to stop reading it. The
end is just as twisted as some of the characters' personalities and&hellip;
Well, I won&rsquo;t spoil it for you this time! Go get the book from your
public library and let me know what you thought of the second book. :)</p>
