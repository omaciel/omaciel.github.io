            <article><p>Yesterday was my 6th wedding anniversary&hellip; Elizabeth and I lived
together for almost 2 years first&hellip; to get to know each other&hellip; to
experience what married life would be like before actually doing it.
After only 3 months I just knew she was the one and I was destined to
spend the rest of my life with her&hellip; grow old with her&hellip; The problem
was that I didn&rsquo;t make enough to support the both of us&hellip; so we lived
together, sharing a 3 bedroom apartment with some folks&hellip;</p>
<p>Around September 2000 I was offered a great job with an up and coming
pharmaceutical company, paying me almost 2.5 times what I was getting
paid. I didn&rsquo;t wait too long and October 16th, 2000 Elizabeth and I
became one!</p>
<p>Six years have passed and we are still happy together. She has stood
behind every single decision I have made, and she just <strong>gets</strong> me! How
else can you explain how a couple who shared no interests managed to get
married? She is the opposite of everything I am! When I&rsquo;m hot, she&rsquo;s
cold&hellip; I like beer, she likes water&hellip; I love hockey, she won&rsquo;t stand
sports&hellip; I love working around computers, she is happy with her tv&hellip;
Without a doubt, we are a very odd couple! :)</p>
<p>Our story has brought us to a new chapter in our adventure, where we&rsquo;ve
moved 500 miles South of where we both grew up, with
an-almost-5-year-old daughter named Yv (pronounced Evie) and another
girl who shall be born mid February 2007.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had our ups and downs but we have managed to stay together&hellip; My
love for her gets stronger every day and I can absolutely say I&rsquo;m still
very much in love with that girl who was so important in the most dark
period of my life! So far I really like where this story is headed, so
I&rsquo;ll keep reading it&hellip; ;)</p>
