            <article><p><img src="http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/4205159532_76ba5831af-190x300.jpg" alt="Kindle DX"></p>
<p>Over the holidays I got a second-hand <strong>Kindle DX</strong> from my
<a href="http://www.productpasha.com/">sister</a>. As I have been doing some
<a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1254">serious reading</a> these last couple of
years, an <strong>EBook</strong> reader was something that both excited and scared me
at the same time. Let me explain.</p>
<p>Being able to carry several books, often pretty thick and heavy, in one
simple and light device has its advantages. Add to that the <strong>massive
number of free EBooks and regular plain text books</strong> available on web
sites such as the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/texts">Internet
Archive</a>, <a href="http://openlibrary.org/">Open
Library</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project
Gutenberg</a>, and all of a sudden
we&rsquo;re talking about having your own private and portable library on the
go! Even <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> has several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html/ref=amb_link_40669842_101?_encoding=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%2F%3Fnode%3D2245146011&amp;token=3A0F170E7CEFE27BDC730D3D7344512BC1296B83&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-5&amp;pf_rd_r=0JHKXGTZSV0D2B7PFQ8B&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1276331502&amp;pf_rd_i=2245146011">classic
books</a>
completely FREE of charge for those who have a <strong>Kindle</strong>!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;scary&rdquo; part, however, is that I actually like the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of paper
between my fingers as I flip the pages of a good book or while I peruse
a newspaper. Call me old fashioned, but I&rsquo;ve been reading the &ldquo;old way&rdquo;
for too long and certain habits are hard to change. There&rsquo;s also the
fact that,  (I wonder if other EBook Readers vendors do the same?) if
Amazon decides to recall a book that is already legally paid for
and downloaded in your Kindle, they can &ldquo;reach out&rdquo; and remove it
whenever they feel like it. That alone prevented me from buying a Kindle
and the only reason I now have one is because it was a gift. Talk about
a conflict of interests!</p>
<p>So as I drove home after the holidays and spent the night at a hotel
somewhere in Northern Virginia, I proceeded to fill up my device with
books and explore its features. The first thing I did was install
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> in my netbook. Since I&rsquo;m running
bleeding edge <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org">Foresight Linux</a> I was
able to get a fairly new version installed (and later on that same week
the latest version was available) and off I went to manage the Kindle.
Also, as I keep most of my EBooks in a
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/home">Dropbox</a> directory, adding them was piece
of cake!</p>
<p>I must say that the built in <strong>New Oxford American Dictionary</strong> and the
possibility of getting the definition of the words from the page you&rsquo;re
reading in one second is very, very handy! There&rsquo;s also an experimental
<strong>Text to Speech</strong> feature that I haven&rsquo;t tried yet but could totally
take advantage of one of these days. Oh, the <strong>battery lasts forever</strong>
and even though this is not the super small and light <strong>Kindle 3</strong>, it
still weighs close to nothing!</p>
<p>Almost 2 weeks later and I have already read <strong>2 books</strong> and am
currently working on my third for 2011, a bit ahead of my goal of
reading <strong>52 total books for the year</strong>! I feel that I am reading a bit
faster now and not straining my eyes as much as before. I still miss
holding a real book every afternoon when I take 1 hour to read. I also
haven&rsquo;t been to the <strong>Public Library</strong> this year yet but that aspect is
not going to change as it has become sort of a Sunday ritual for our
family.</p>
<p>I figure that I may start blogging about the books I read from now on
and provide a small review for anyone interested out there, so expect my
first <strong>book review</strong> for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Book-1/dp/0439023521/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1294760218&amp;sr=8-1">The Hunger Games (Part 1)</a>&quot;
 fairly soon!</p>
