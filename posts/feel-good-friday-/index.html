<p>This is more of a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; post, mostly for me! Through my life I
have come across a fork on the road many times, and for the last 4+
years I have always chosen the path to the <strong>right</strong>. Even when the left
side sometimes looked a bit more &ldquo;paved&rdquo; and less difficult to walk
through, I still chose the <strong>right path</strong>! The reasons are many, but I
think I can distill them into one single sentence: I believe!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking about the technology that we develop here at
<a href="http://www.rpath.com">rPath</a> and apparently, I&rsquo;m not the only one to
feel this way either! It makes me extremely proud to know that something
I work on is perceived as a game changer to a bunch of people!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The challenge that most IT organizations have today when it comes to
the complexity of enterprise IT is an inability to visualize the
relationships between all the moving parts that make up a specific IT
service. While there has been some resistance to IT automation
historically, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that enterprise IT will not scale in
this age of virtualization and cloud computing without it.&quot;- <strong>Mike
Vizard</strong>, CTO <strong>Edge</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The future of IT lies in storing system knowledge in an automated
system and putting it to use when a new system is about to be
unleashed.&quot;Â - <strong>Charlie Babcock</strong>, <strong>InformationWeek</strong></p>
<p>&quot;There are two main strengths to [rPath X6]: The DevOps
articulation is the major strength&mdash;configuring and releasing a new
application or changes to an application is a process fraught with
human errors. The complexity is such that issues are inevitable. These
issues have a ripple effect on service quality and agility. The other
major strength is the IT service supply chain that will play a major
role in the future. IT will have a choice of delivery platforms that
they did not have before [physical server, virtual server, public or
private cloud]. Applications will need to be easily &quot;movable&quot; to
any platform. This is where rPath has a big role to play.&quot; - <strong>JP
Garbani</strong>, <strong>Forrester</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Pity the poor admin whose job it is to keep track of all the
versions of operating systems, applications and firmware and the
interdepencies between them all, so as not to hit a conflict when
installing or deinstalling something that brings everything grinding
to a halt. In a cloud environment, when everything is virtualized it
gets even harder to manage as resources are constantly being moved
around.&quot; - <strong>Jo Maitland</strong>, <strong>SearchCloudComputing.com</strong></p>
<p>&quot;rPath is an integral part of our strategy, providing a powerful
solution for automating and standardizing how we turn applications
into deployable systems and how we maintain and re-use them over time.
For most companies this is a manual, cumbersome process, but rPath
makes it simple and automated. We&rsquo;re very excited about this
next-generation version of rPath, in particular the dynamic and visual
user experience and rich configuration management capabilities it
introduces.&quot; - <strong>Ed Seymour</strong>, <strong>Fujitsu</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Enterprise IT is undergoing a radical transformation fueled by scale
and change, contracting budgets, and the growing need for speed,
Because of massive system complexity and the need for rapid deployment
and change, IT needs a new and better approach. They cannot achieve
this quality without embracing an automated application release
solution to ensure efficient, repeatable, accurate and reliable
application deployments.&quot; - <strong>Ronni Colville</strong>, <strong>Gartner</strong></p>
