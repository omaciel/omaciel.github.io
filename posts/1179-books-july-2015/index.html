<p>This <strong>July 2015</strong> I travelled to the <strong>Red Hat</strong> office in <strong>Brno,
Czech Republic</strong> to spend some time with my teammates there, and I
managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being
jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up some of
the books that had been lingering on my <em>ToDo</em> list and even managed to
finally read a few of the books that together make up the <strong>Chronicles
of Narnia</strong>, since I had never read them as a kid.</p>

<p>Out of all the books I read this month, I feel that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the
Western
Front</a>
and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October
Country</a>
were the ones I enjoyed reading the most, closely followed by
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a>,
which took me a while to get through. The other books, with the
exception of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+Memoirs+of+Sherlock+Holmes">The Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes</a>,
helped me pass the time when I only wanted to be entertained.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=All+Quiet+on+the+Western+Front">All Quiet on the Western
Front</a>
takes the prize for being one of the best books I have ever read! I felt
that the way <strong>WWI</strong> was presented through the eyes of the main
character was a great way to represent all the pain, angst and suffering
that all sides of conflict went through, without catering for any
particular side or having an agenda. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Erich+Maria+Remarque">Erich Maria
Remarque</a>'s
style had me some times breathless, some times with a knot on the pit of
my stomach I as 'endured' the many life changing events that took
place in the book. Is this an action-packed book about WWI? Will it read
like a thriller? In my opinion, even though there are many chapters with
gory details about killings and battles, the answer is a very bland
'maybe'. I think that the real 'star' of this book is its
philosophical view of the war and how the main characters, all around
19-20 years of age, learn to deal with its life lasting effects.</p>
<p>Now, I have been a huge fan of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray
Bradbury</a>
for a while now, and when I got <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+October+Country">The October
Country</a>
for my birthday last month, I just knew that it would be time well spent
reading it. For those of you who are more acquainted his science fiction
works, this book will surprise you as it shows you a bit of his
'darker' side. All of the short stories included in this collection
deal with death, mysterious apparitions, inexplicable endings and are
sure to spook you a little bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a>
was at times slow, some other times funny and, especially toward the
end, a very entertaining book. Weighing in at a hefty 1000 pages
(depending on the edition you have, plus/minus 50 odd pages), this book
covers two different periods in the lives of a number of different
characters, past (around <strong>WWII</strong>) and present, all different threads
eventually leading to a great finale. Alternating between past and
present, the story takes us to the early days of how <strong>cryptology</strong> was
'officially invented' and used during the war, and how many of the
events that took place back then were affecting the lives of some of the
direct descendants of the main characters in our present day. As you go
through the back and forth you start to gather bits and pieces of
information that eventually connects all the dots of an interesting
puzzle. It definitely requires a long term commitment to go though it,
but it was enjoyable and, as I mention before, it made me laugh at many
places.</p>
<p>The verdict is still out for
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Armada">Armada</a>,
maybe because I had very high expectations for it after reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ready+Player+One">Ready
Player
One</a>
last December. You still see a ton of references to the 80s but the main
focus seems to be dedicated to videogames, old and new, and how the main
character, Zach Lightman, learns that all the numerous hours he spent in
front of his computer pays off when a bunch of aliens one day decide to
visit Earth with not so friendly intentions. The book reads a lot like
<strong>Enders Game</strong>, which I didn't quite enjoy to be honest. I just can't
relate to books where the main character is a very young and immature
person who all of a sudden has these 'mad skills' that puts them in a
position to take charge of whole armies! Now, I understand that this is
a work of science fiction and that it is not supposed to match reality,
etc, etc, and I tried to keep this in mind all the while I read the
book. But things happened way too quickly and without having more
information (chapters?) showing how a kid who <strong>only</strong> plays videogames
'for a living' can acquire the skills and experience required to get
to where he got, the whole story felt too... artificial? Anyhow, even
with all these issues I still managed to enjoy the book, mostly because
of the 80s references. I gave it 3 (out of 5) starts.</p>

are books that I have been chipping away for close to two months now...
the real reason why it is taking me a while to get through them is
two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=S">S</a> reads
like a huge puzzle/detective board game and it really requires a lot
of work to get through. For every actual page of story, there are
dozens of messages and notes scribbled on the side and in the
margins which, once you put them together, should guide you to the
solution of a mystery hidden underneath it all. It is slow reading,
and since I usually read to relax after a long day of work, I find
myself shying away from it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Fluent+Python">Fluent

is a <strong>great</strong> technical book. I use <strong>Python</strong> at work. See my
point above about reading to relax :)</li>

<p>I found myself with about US$100 left in credits for my <strong>Amazon</strong>
account, which is always dangerous with me... and to make things
'worse', two promising books were released this July 14th: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Go+Set+a+Watchman">Go Set a
Watchman</a>
and
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Armada">Armada</a>.
Up until then I was doing pretty good actually, only buying three used
books... but then, on the 14th, BOOM! Since I bought
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Armada">Armada</a> I
figured I just had to also get <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ready+Player+One">Ready Player
One</a>
(which I read last December and loved it)... and my <strong>GoodReads</strong> list
happened to be open too, so I went ahead and got <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=The+War+of+the+End+of+the+World">The War of the End of
the
World</a>,
not to mention that I pre-order another book and a magazine!!! However,
and I am proud to say this, I still managed to get around US$17
left... which is still very dangerous :)</p>
<p>What about you? What kind of interesting books have you read this past
month???</p>
