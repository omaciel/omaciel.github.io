            <article><p>Over the weekend I finally took the first step towards my resolution to
take a more active role in helping out the open source community. As of
last Friday, I joined the hordes of developers and open source
enthusiasts who signed up for Ubuntu&rsquo;s LaunchPad project and offered to
help with the ongoing process of translating applications and documents
from English to Portuguese (Brazil). I spoke with the organizer for this
specific translation effort and was told to submit suggestions to some
of the sections still pending.</p>
<p>Having not been officially accepted as part of the team, I guess they
wanted to see if I was really willing to go through it and not just
wasting their time. For approximately 17 years I lived in Brazil and my
knowledge of the language and grammar is something I was very proud of.
However, for the last 14-15 years I haven&rsquo;t really used it much and am a
bit rusty&hellip; but I guess this is like riding a bike&hellip; Once I started
translating, something inside me woke up and it was smooth sailing&hellip; I
did, however, have a hard time trying to translate certain tecnical
words for I had never learned or used them in Portuguese before.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on the <a href="https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/breezy/+sources/ubuntu-docs/+pots/faqguide/pt_BR">Translation of faqguide into Portuguese
(Brazil)
(pt_BR)</a>
and 2 other minor application translations. I have also spent several
hours hanging out on #ubuntu @ Freenode on IRC and managed to help out
a few users. I hope to be able to spend more time there as well as help
out translating more documents to Portuguese (Brazil). One day I can
tell future Brazilian Ubuntu users that I helped this great distro (and
some open source applications) by making it available to them in their
native language!</p>
