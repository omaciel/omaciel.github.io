            <article><p>Sometimes I wonder how certain people get employed&hellip; really! I usually
get drilled with a bunch of technical questions in every job interview
I&rsquo;ve gone to (with the exception of a couple where the hiring manager
had absolutely no clue about IT&hellip; this re-enforces me original point!)
and feel that I really have to show &ldquo;what I&rsquo;m made of.&rdquo; In the meantime,
some people get hired and surprisingly manage to keep their jobs whilst
they lack (IMNSHO) the knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>For instance, yesterday this guy who works for our &ldquo;.Net Division&rdquo;
approached me while I heated my lunch and asked me how (i.e. the code) a
form/window could call another one and display it on the screen!?!? At
first I didn&rsquo;t know what to think and gave him the benefit of the
doubt&hellip; Maybe I didn&rsquo;t understand the question correctly. So I
re-phrased the question, giving names to the objects (i.e. form1 and
form2) and in a way wishing the question was a bit more complicated than
just:</p>
<p><strong>Form1:</strong> <em>[snip]</em></p>
<p><code>Dim secondForm as new Form2() secondForm.ShowDialog()</code></p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong! The guy looked at me with the facial expression of
someone who had just put on an old pair of jeans and found a $50 bill
in one of the pockets! He still asked me if he could come up to my
cubicle and ask me more questions if he had problems &ldquo;implementing&rdquo; the
code! You see, I&rsquo;m not trying to be a smart ass here&hellip; This guys walks
around the office claiming to be a great programmer, showing off his
recently acquired PMP certificate.</p>
<p>Today I was telling a friend and a co-worker (self proclaimed web
application developer for the last 6 years!) about my previous post (the
one about the hacker who hacked himself) when she turned to me and
asked:</p>
<p>&quot;127.0.0.1??? What is that???&quot;</p>
<p>Trying really hard to hide my desbelief I explained it to her what it
meant, holding back this incredible force the compelled me to ask what
kind of web development she&rsquo;s done in the past 6 years!</p>
