            <article><p>Yesterday while waiting for my wife at the doctor&rsquo;s office, I managed to
take a peek at an older issue of the <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/">American
Scientist</a>.Ã‚Â  Ever since I
graduated from Pace University with my BS in Biochemistry, I rarely read
anything too scientific and tend to browse more computer related
magazines.Ã‚Â  Anyhow, the very first article, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/50686;jsessionid=aaa6LlVfj2KD0a">Gauss&rsquo;s Day of
Reckoning</a>&quot;
by <a href="http://bit-player.org/">Brian Hayes</a> caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 1780s a provincial German schoolmaster gave his class the
tedious assignment of summing the first 100 integers. The teacher&rsquo;s
aim was to keep the kids quiet for half an hour, but one young pupil
almost immediately produced an answer: 1 + 2 + 3 + &hellip; + 98 + 99 + 100
= 5,050. The smart aleck was Carl Friedrich Gauss, who would go on to
join the short list of candidates for greatest mathematician ever.
Gauss was not a calculating prodigy who added up all those numbers in
his head. He had a deeper insight: If you &ldquo;fold&rdquo; the series of numbers
in the middle and add them in pairsÃ¢â‚¬â€?1 + 100, 2 + 99, 3 + 98,
and so onÃ¢â‚¬â€?all the pairs sum to 101. There are 50 such pairs,
and so the grand total is simply 50Ãƒâ€&quot;101. The more general formula,
for a list of consecutive numbers from 1 through <em>n</em>, is <em>n</em>(<em>n</em> +
1)/2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carl F. Glauss was only 7 years of age when the above event took
place!Ã‚Â  Now, I have met a handfull of &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; kids growing up in
Brazil, some of them even able to mesmerize people with feats like the
one described above.Ã‚Â  But the article goes a bit further into his
earlier life, when he supposedly corrected his dad&rsquo;s mathematical
equation at the tender age of <strong>three</strong>!!!Ã‚Â  I couldn&rsquo;t possibly
imagine any 3-years-old kid that I&rsquo;ve met/seen doing such a thing.Ã‚Â 
Throught history, I&rsquo;ve heard of famous composers who could write an
entire symphony by the age of four, or recite Homer by heart while
dancing the macarena!Ã‚Â  Well, maybe not the latter, but I think you&rsquo;ve
got the picture. :)</p>
<p>I remember being 5&hellip; and I think I can vaguely remember one or two
events from the time I was 3&hellip; and let me tell you something, I don&rsquo;t
remember doing anything out of the ordinary than playing in the sand,
running around with the other kids, and watching lots of cartoons.Ã‚Â 
There was also a lot of learning going on, but mostly it was one sided,
where my parents taught me about the world around me, and I tried to
absorb as much as my attention allowed me.Ã‚Â  :)</p>
<p>I wonder if all the technological &ldquo;progress&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve undergone since those
long days have actually been beneficial at all.Ã‚Â  In a society that
pretty much &ldquo;learns&rdquo; and &ldquo;socilaizes&rdquo; via the internet, television, and
eletronic gadgets, how can one really learn to discover the world
without interference?</p>
