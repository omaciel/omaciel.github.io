<p>It is with a great pleasure that I announce the release of my pet
project <a href="http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/">BillReminder</a>! The
road to 0.3 has been a very educational journey for me, and looking back
when I first decided to port my original code written in C# to Python
just so that I could learn more about Python, I can say that I have
learned quite a bit. I have also met some fabulous people along the way,
some of them very responsible for me keeping the project going. I can
trully say that whenever I find the time to work on this project, I lose
track of time. Whenever I feel insecure about my own skills (or when
people make me feel that way) I take a look at what I have done so
far&hellip; it may not be the best piece of software out there, but it is
mine&hellip; written from scratch!</p>
<p>My plan was to release BillReminder on February 15th, in honor of my
second daughter Kate&rsquo;s first birthday. But unfeortunately time wasn&rsquo;t on
my side, as work and my personal life caught up to me. I want to
sincerely thank all of those who took the time to test it and send in
feedback and even patches! I want to specially thank my friend <strong>Luiz
Armesto</strong> for sticking around and sharing the same enthusiasm at
creating something from scratch and having fun while at it!</p>
<p>So what is new with this release? A lot actually:</p>
<p>This was a massive rewrite of the entire application, and instead of
listing all files that have been changd, I&rsquo;ll try to highlight the most
important changes and features instead.</p>
<p><strong>GLADE:</strong> BillReminder 0.3 was entirely re-written in order to remove
all glade files and dependencies. The initial idea was to simply get rid
of the dependency, but it also served as a learning process for me (and
I believe the other contributors will agree with this as well).
<strong>DBUS:</strong> The DBUS layer received a bit more love from Luiz Armesto,
breaking it down into the proper calls so to separate the &lsquo;engine&rsquo; per
se from the client. <strong>UI</strong>: The user interface has also gone a series of
changes and (hopefully) improvements. It is probably not 100% HIG
compliant yet, but we&rsquo;ll gladly accept suggestions. <strong>Bug management</strong>:
Towards the last 8 weeks of development we&rsquo;ve adopted the habit of
filing bug reports prior to fixing the issues that we encountered during
the development cycle. <strong>Translations:</strong> All prior contributors promptly
replied to my email asking them to update their translations:</p>

Foresight users playing with the newer alpha 4 can install it using
conary&hellip; Mandriva and Arch Linux packages should be coming your way
soon too!</p>
