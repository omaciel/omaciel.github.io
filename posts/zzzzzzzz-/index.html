            <article><p>I&rsquo;m back home, together with my wife and daughters. The two days spent
in the hospital helped them (wife and baby) to recharge a bit their
energies, and gave me some time to spend with my older daughter.</p>
<p>Many were the comments and emails I received during this period, all
congratulating us and wishing us well. I even received a phone call from
Brazil (thanks a million Kurt Kraut)! In the name of my (now slightly
bigger) family I thank each and everyone of you for the kind words!</p>
<p>My company was kind enough to let me take 5 days off from work so I
could be with &ldquo;the girls,&rdquo; and boy have they been helpful! Our first day
at home was a bit rough since Kate cried every 30 minutes. It was only
today, right after I drove Yv to school that I was able to take a 2 hour
nap. By my calculations, I now have only 8 more to make up for&hellip; ;)</p>

<p>Things are shaping up at home, and if I had any concerns about how Yv
would behave now that she has a little sister, now I have none. Every
day, right before she goes to school, she insists in giving her little
sister a kiss. ;)</p>
<p>The temperature here in North Carolina has gone up a bit, compared to
New York and New Jersey, and with today&rsquo;s 71Â F we decided to go out and
visit (my first time) <a href="http://www.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>'s
<a href="http://www.chapel.duke.edu/home/">Chapel</a>. The Duke campus is
absolutely wonderful and it gives you this feeling of the vast amount of
knowledge and history that just seeps from its walls! I couldn&rsquo;t help
but fantasize about the day my daughters will be attending either Duke
or <a href="http://www.unc.edu/">UNC</a>.</p>

<p>With Spring just around the corner, I&rsquo;m sure we will be going on more
small trips and taking a whole lot more pictures. Spring is a very
interesting season, specially having gone through a few months of
Winter. It only takes a few positive degrees to get people to come out
and show off their &ldquo;Winter tan,&rdquo; trying to enjoy every second of warmth
given off by the yet pale sun. For my next trip, I&rsquo;m going for the
second time to <a href="http://www.hr.duke.edu/dukegardens/">Duke Gardens</a>. This
place is so enchanting that not even the Hanging Gardens of Babylon
would come close. This time around I will bring my real camera&hellip; so no
more cel phone pictures. :)</p>
