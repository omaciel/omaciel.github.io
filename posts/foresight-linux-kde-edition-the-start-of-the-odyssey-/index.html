            <p class="blog-post-meta">Nov 14, 2007
                </p>

            
            <article><p>As I mentioned in my previous post, I decided to give KDE a chance on my
home system. For the last 5 days I&rsquo;ve been neck deep in KDE land, with
some fairly minor trips to non-KDE applications when I can&rsquo;t figure out
how to get something done (more on the soon).</p>
<p>The first step was to download the brand spanking alpha ISO for
<strong>Foresight Linux KDE Edition</strong>
(x86 <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/build?id=13206">here</a>
and
x86_64 <a href="http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/build?id=13207">here</a>)
and bring it home. I waited until everyone was asleep to backup my files
and got ready for the long install&hellip; AND BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED! The
install, including formatting my 200GB hard drive took 4 MINUTES!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ogmaciel/2009708182/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2004/2009708182_a4f58903da.jpg" alt="Foresight, KDEEdition"></a></p>
<p>Once I rebooted the machine I was faced with a pretty vanilla KDE
installation, with pretty much most of the applications out there
already installed for me. Since the last time I played with KDE was
several years ago, I took my time learning the applications and tweaking
my desktop look and feel to my heart&rsquo;s content. The first thing that
captured my fancy was <strong>Amarok</strong>! WOW! I loaded my 22 GB of music in
there and let it sort it all out, including getting covers for the
albums, and moved on to <strong>Akregator</strong>. Having been a Liferea user for
quite some time, I felt right at ease with it and was able to import my
old feeds and start reading my news in no time.</p>
<p>Another application that has been tested and beaten to death is
<strong>Konqueror</strong>, and so far I have had only a few issues. Mind you that
<strong>Firefox</strong> is installed by default, but I wanted to have the whole KDE
experience and only used it for one single task. Right away I tried to
check my gmail and was warned that my browser wasn&rsquo;t fully supported&hellip;
WHAT? The work around was to &ldquo;fake&rdquo; the site to think I was running
Firefox and the warning message was gone. If anyone from Google is
reading this, using my (really bad) Brooklyn accent: &ldquo;Hey! Wasamatter
with you?&rdquo; That is just ridiculous and I hope Konqueror gets its much
deserved love from Google. Now, the only issue I had with Konqueror was
when I tried to upload pictures into my
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ogmaciel/2009708182/">Flickr</a> account (by
the way, my PRO account expires today). For some reason, the browser
would bring me right back to the upload form as soon as I hit the save
button&hellip; that is when I fired up Firefox to bail me out. Weird.</p>
<p>Back to the distro, up until now the KDE edition has pretty much been
handled by a couple of guys (hey <strong>jtate</strong> and <strong>int</strong>!) and not much
time has been invested into making it more organized and give it some
proper love. I noticed that there were lots and lots of redundant
applications around and in some cases some categories were left out. The
only video player available was <strong>Noatun</strong> and it didn&rsquo;t really work for
me (something related to being compiled against a conflicting arts
plugin). So the solution was to take advantage of a couple of free hours
here and there, coupled with the awesome power of the <a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary">conary packaging
system</a> to start shaping it into&hellip;
errr&hellip; shape. I mean, I have never packaged anything in my life before
using conary, and so far I have taken on the maintenance of a few
packages. Obviously I have had help along the way, and <a href="http://ken.vandine.org/">Ken
Vandine</a> and <a href="http://sbin.reboot.sh">AntÃƒÂ³nio &ldquo;doniphon&rdquo;
Meireles</a> have taught me a lot! Anyone interested
in learning more about packaging or just curious about conary should
stop by #foresight and #conary on Freenode.</p>
<p>My idea is to make a list of all the current, installed by default
applications in each category and pick one to be installed by default.
Under &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;, leave Konqueror, Firefox, Kopete, Konversation,
Akregator and maybe KTorrent? Under &ldquo;Multimedia&rdquo;, Amarok (no brainer),
Kaffeine&hellip; WAIT!!! Kaffeine is not available! Luckily, a mere 9 lines
of python-like syntax yielded a brand new
<a href="http://kaffeine.kde.org">Kaffeine</a> application, packaged and ready to
be used by the masses! Let me say that again: <strong>NINE</strong> lines and it was
packaged! I told you conary was powerfull!</p>

<p>So, what can you do to lend us a hand? Well, there are lots to do and
there&rsquo;s room for everyone! You can start by downloading the ISO and
playing with it. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning about conary so you
can help out with packaging, read the
<a href="http://wiki.foresightlinux.com/confluence/display/docs/FAQ">FAQ</a>,
<a href="http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary:QuickReference">Quick Reference</a> and
joining us on #foresight. Is art design your bag? We still don&rsquo;t have a
nice green theme yet! How would you like to have your art in our
distro??? Remember, <strong>Foresight is Green</strong>!</p>
<p>My KDE Odyssey has just begun! More to come&hellip;</p>
