            <p class="blog-post-meta">Jun 8, 2007
                </p>

            
            <article><p>It is 04:18 EST and instead of being in bed, I&rsquo;m in front of the
computer. Due to a major sore throat, I&rsquo;ve been struggling to sleep
since 22:00 of last night&hellip; and so far the sore throat has shown no
sign of retreat. Tired of laying awake in bed, I figured I&rsquo;d do
something else&hellip;</p>
<p>Since it is my birthday today, and I&rsquo;m still sleep deprived, I came up
with the &ldquo;great idea&rdquo; of writing my own <strong>F.A.Q.</strong>! hehehe For those
questions I have been asked one too many times. :)</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is Og your real name? What kind of name is it? <strong>A</strong>: Yes&hellip; some
people think my name is short for something else (and I always joke
around, telling them that it stands for <strong>O' Greatness</strong> or <strong>Original
Gangster</strong>), but it isn&rsquo;t. My parents named me after the writer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Og_Mandino">Og
Mandino</a>, whose books had
really impressed my mom.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why are you always talking about Brazil? <strong>A</strong>: Well, that one is
simple to answer. I was born there.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Every time I see a picture of you, you&rsquo;re on crutches. What
happened? <strong>A</strong>: I was born with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis">Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita, a
rare congenital disorder that causes multiple joint
contractures</a>. When I was
born, my limbs were all folded into themselves, pretty much like the
symbol &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo;. Through my first 6-7 years I went through several corrective
surgeries, but my doctors didn&rsquo;t give any hope to my parents. My mom
never believed them and travelled the entire country looking for a
better treatment. At age of 7 I was given my very first pair of
crutches, which my dad had made for me out of some pieces of wood we had
around the house and <strong>broom sticks</strong>! You should have seen the look at
my doctor&rsquo;s face when my mom brought me back into their office, doing my
best to &ldquo;parade&rdquo; with my newly found &ldquo;walking skills&rdquo;. ;)</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What do you do in the Open Source community? Are you one of those
super hackers? <strong>A</strong>: Far from it! Most of my collaboration has been as
a translator for the Brazilian Portuguese language. This work eventually
led me to become the leader for the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-pt-br">Ubuntu Brazilian Portuguese
Translators</a> team for 18
months, position now held by my good friend <a href="http://andrenoel.com.br/">AndrÃƒÂ©
Noel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What GNU/Linux distribution do you currently use? <strong>A</strong>: I&rsquo;ve
been running <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a> for the
last 5 months now. There are a great deal of great distributions out
there, and even though I had been an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>
user for quite some time, I chose the one that would not only allow me
to have a solid desktop experience, but allow me to do my work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: So what GNU/Linux distribution do you recommend to me? <strong>A</strong>:
That will depend on your needs. Since I&rsquo;m a firm believer that GNU/Linux
== Freedom, it would be extremelly hypocrite of me to tell anyone what
to use! My initial answer will always be &ldquo;Use what best fits your
needs!&rdquo; As I had mentioned before, there are several great ditributions
out there, each with its strengths and weaknesses. If you afford to try
a few, I&rsquo;d suggest you give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What have you been working on? <strong>A</strong>: Lately, my personal life
has taken a solid hold of me, and when I&rsquo;m not doing my paid work, I&rsquo;m
out and about, enjoying the North Carolina weather with my family. I&rsquo;m
also working with the upstream translation teams for GNOME and KDE and
writing a graphical interface for Foresight&rsquo;s package management system.
This Summer I want to find some time to go fishing and read a few books.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I must have bored you all by now so I&rsquo;ll stop. If you&rsquo;ve
made through here and feel inclined to ask me anything else, feel free.
