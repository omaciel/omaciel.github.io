            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 15, 2007
                </p>

            
            <article><p>Shortly after receiving a comment on my
<a href="http://blog.ogmaciel.com">other</a> blog (Brazilian Portuguese only) from
<strong>Armando Silva</strong> about an educational Live CD, my curiosity got the
best of me and I just had to check it out.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was point my browser to the <a href="http://www.gcompris-br.org/">Brazilian
GCompris</a> site and I was imediately
impressed by their stated objectives of promoting the translation and
documentation of education software in Brazil</p>
<p>A few more paragraphs later I found out that <strong>Armando Silva</strong> himself
was responsible for this Live CD, based on Knoppix with components from
Kanotix e Sidux.Ã‚Â  The CD is filled with educational applications,
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gcompris 8.3 beta3</li>
<li>Some of the KDE-Edu applications</li>
<li>Childsplay</li>
<li>TuxMath</li>
<li>TuxType</li>
</ul>
<p>The CD also has other windows managers such as KDE, Enlightenment and
Fluxbox, as well as aMSN, Subversion, Gaim, Iceweasel (Firefox) in 50
languages, support for a great number of languages and sports the kernel
2.6.20-4 compiled for the i386 with many additional drivers.</p>
<p>Salivating in antecipation, I opened up my VirtualBox amd created a new
partition and image with 256 MB of RAM.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25563799@N00/498873970/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/228/498873970_878ab0e536.jpg" alt="Boot up screen for the Educational GCompris LiveCD"></a></p>
<p>I was very impressed with the options: KDE, Enlightenment 17 and
Fluxbox, all Live! I didn&rsquo;t hesitate and chose Enlightenment. The boot
process is all animated with a very pleasant voice explaining what was
being done, while a funny looking penguin waddled across the screen.</p>

<p>The other cool thing was the variety of applications available, and even
running it inside VirtualBox with a meager 256 MB of RAM, I had no
problems running any of the games&hellip; and boy, have they got educational
games!!!</p>

<p>I played with at least 5 games (and the person who is really going to
test drive it is Yv, my oldest, who was fast asleep when I decided to do
this) and I laughed my self silly playing the game above, a game that
was fairly popular many decades ago in Brazil.Ã‚Â  I also remembered an
old Atari game (which unfortunately I don&rsquo;t remember the name&hellip;
something raider?) where you had to stop lightening bolts from touching
down the ground&hellip; But in this game, you had mathematical questions
scrolling down the screen and you had to stop them by typing the correct
solution.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25563799@N00/498871508/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/203/498871508_9c5f873b95.jpg" alt="Solve the mathematicalproblems"></a></p>
<p>There was also a Microsoft Paint clone that looked very interesting. I
then tried a program that teaches you how to type.Ã‚Â  The game has
several levels but I only tried the first one, where you have to help
Tux eat as many fishes by typing the corresponding letter falling down
the screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25563799@N00/498871086/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/212/498871086_aec8cafb25.jpg" alt="Typinggame"></a></p>
<p>After a little while I decided to stop my exploratio and wait until
tomorrow so Yv has a chance to find out new stuff too. I can already see
her face brighten with excitement when she sees some of this stuff!</p>
<p>Now, a little bit of trivia for you:Ã‚Â  Does anyone know the meaning of
the picture below, showing off KGeography?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25563799@N00/498917511/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/195/498917511_349cba0db3.jpg" alt="A little bit ofgeography"></a></p>
<p>Overall, I was extremelly pleased with this initiative, and I urge those
with kids or have little brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, and want to
support a great open source project, download your
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=24002&amp;use_mirror=jaist&amp;filename=ACADEMIA4.ISO&amp;51393535">copy</a>
today! And if you speak Portuguese or just want to find out how you can
help out, contact the guys behind <a href="http://gcompris-br.org/">GCompris
Brasil</a> (I&rsquo;ll be glad to help out if you have
any trouble with the language barrier) and check out how to help them!</p>
