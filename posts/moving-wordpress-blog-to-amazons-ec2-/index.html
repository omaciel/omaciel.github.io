<p>You probably remember <a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=1303">reading</a> about
my issues with running my <strong>WordPress</strong>-based blog on <strong>Dreamhost</strong>'s
environment, and how frustrated I was with the experience of using their
<strong>Private Server</strong> services. The short version is that I eventually
migrated my blog back to their shared hosting environment, turned
off most of the plugins and cried myself to sleep.</p>
<p>The very next day, after reading (and replying to) the comments I
received, one in particular caught my eye: <strong>Amazon&rsquo;s Free Usage Tier</strong>
offering new customers the following <strong>EC2</strong> services each month for one
year:</p>
<ul>
<li>750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage</li>
<li>750 hours of <strong>Elastic Load Balancing</strong> plus 15 GB data processing</li>
<li>10 GB of <strong>Amazon Elastic Block Storage</strong> (EBS) plus 1 million IOs,
1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000
snapshot Put Requests</li>
<li>15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across
all AWS service</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds really good, doesn&rsquo;t it? I took a good look around and saw a
couple of interesting
<a href="http://www.agileweboperations.com/migrate-your-wordpress-blog-to-a-bitnami-ec2-instance">blog</a>
<a href="http://blog.jayway.com/2009/05/07/blogging-among-the-clouds/">posts</a>
from people who took advantage of this offer to move their blogs &ldquo;to the
clouds&rdquo;, and being the adventurous guys that I am, I signed up for a new
account and proceeded to take the steps to move this blog to my own EC2
instance.</p>
<p>The first thing was to create a back up/dump of my blog&rsquo;s database and
WordPress files. I then started looking for a good Linux appliance with
all the necessary applications (i.e. <strong>Apache, MySQL, PHP</strong>, etc) as I
didn&rsquo;t feel like starting with a plain &ldquo;bare bones&rdquo; system and
installing individual packages. I looked for a <strong>CentOS</strong>-based
appliance but as I couldn&rsquo;t really tell how good some of the ones that
came up in my search were, I ended up choosing the WordPress stack from
<a href="http://bitnami.org/">Bitnami</a>. This proved to be the path of least
resistance in the end as several people seem to have used it to do the
same exact thing I wanted to do (and the fact that it has an active
community also means I can have some level of support).</p>
<p>I highly recommend the instructions from this
<a href="http://www.agileweboperations.com/migrate-your-wordpress-blog-to-a-bitnami-ec2-instance">post</a>
for the process of taking your database dump and using it to populate
your new database (make sure to either create a new user that matches
your existing configuration OR modify your wp-config.py to use the
default user from the instance), and configuring the Apache web server.
Do make sure to read everything, specially the sections related to a
couple of issues that came up for the author, so that you can hopefully
sidestep them. Also, as the appliance already comes with WordPress
installed in  /opt/bitnami/apps/wordpress/htdocs/, you may want to
selectively choose what files to copy from your backup into this
directory, such as themes, plugins, uploads, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, setting up my current domain to redirect to my EC2 instance was
extremely easy to do, using Dreamhost&rsquo;s DNS services (you can use this
<a href="http://manual.squarespace.com/domain-setup/domain-mapping-with-dreamhost.html">example</a>
up to step 6, skipping step 5) in conjunction with Amazon&rsquo;s Elastic IPs.</p>
<p>Today marks the 7th day I switched this blog to my EC2 instance and so
far I have had absolutely no issues or regrets! I feel very confident
that I can expand its capabilities and not worry about bogging it down.
Load average has been around 0.15 and I also have plenty of free RAM to
go around. Once my one year promotion expires, bar any unexpected
surprises, I feel pretty confident that I may continue to use it as a
paid user.</p>
