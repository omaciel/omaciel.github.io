            <article><p><img src="http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/coffeecup-300x237.jpg" alt="Coffee Cup"></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=976">wrote</a> about how I first
got hooked on coffee and received some really good comments and
suggestions for new coffees to try. I was immediately attracted to one
coffee in particular: <a href="http://www.zokacoffee.com/">Zoka</a>! Don&rsquo;t ask me
what it was but there was something about the name that tickled my
fancy. So I sent their customer service department an email and asked if
they would send me a few samples. The very next day I received a reply
and the promisse that they would send me a couple of bags. Since I had
also received 2 other bags of coffee from friends to try I figured I&rsquo;d
report here how the &ldquo;coffee experiment&rdquo; went.</p>
<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t pretend to be an expert or a connoisseur and my oppinion
here is nothing but, well&hellip; my own oppinion and is not meant to
influence what brand of coffee you should buy. I just enjoy drinking
coffee and hope you&rsquo;ll find this useful.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ogmaciel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010-05-17-19.08.27-300x225.jpg" alt="The Great Coffee Experiment">]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zokacoffee.com/">Zoka</a>'s coffee arrived at my doorstep a
few days later on a Friday afternoon. With names such as &ldquo;<strong>Costa Rica
Calle de Copey</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Tangletown Blend</strong>&rdquo;, the two neatly packed
bags of whole beans looked very organic-y. The neat label in the front
telling you when that specific bag was put together was a nice touch,
almost like someone took their time to hand pick the coffee beans and
gently places them into the bag (and it smelled great too!).</p>
<p>I first tried the &ldquo;<strong>Costa Rica Calle de Copey</strong>&quot; with its promisse to
deliver a rich, fruity flavor. After grinding (espresso) enough coffee
for my wife and I and impatiently waiting for the brew, we were both
impressed with the strong flavor of melon and hints of lemon! I mean, I
usually drink my coffee black with sugar (though I&rsquo;ve drastically cut
down on how much sugar I&rsquo;m using now) and am not too fond of fruity
coffee. Maybe because most of the time fruity coffee is a bit too acidic
for me. I must say however that I was not put off by this blend and I
can see myself drinking it out on the back porch after dinner.</p>
<p>The next day I decided to try &ldquo;<strong>Tangletown</strong>&quot; for breakfast and was
very pleased with the experience! Tones of chocolate and caramel seem to
balance the acidity for a robust cup of coffee! I&rsquo;m talking about great
smooth flavor with an almost chocolaty ending! Needless to say I am now
hooked and will need to find a place to buy my next one! As I mentioned
before I still have 2 more bags of coffee to try and am very much
looking forward to trying these 2 Brazilian blends: &quot;<strong>Caboclo</strong>&quot; and
&quot;<strong>Cafe Tres Pontas</strong>&rdquo;! Until then, feel free to drop me a line with
more suggestions or comments. Also, if you come across a bag of
&ldquo;Tangletown&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy it! :)</p>
