            <article><p>This is just too <a href="http://www.jellyslab.com/~bteo/hacker.htm">funny</a>!!!
Not sure if it really happened or not but my professional experience has
proven me wrong many times before! Hehehe&hellip; Read on&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Something nice I read on <a href="http://www.stophiphop.de">www.stophiphop.de</a> (got pointed there by a
comment on <a href="http://www.macguardians.de">www.macguardians.de</a>) is this nice story of a hacker:
`http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new&hellip;php?storyid=184

&lt;http://www.stophiphop.de&gt;`__ (got pointed there by a comment on
`www.macguardians.de &lt;http://www.macguardians.de&gt;`__) is this nice
story of a hacker:
<a href="http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new...php?storyid=184">http://www.beast.mos-worlds.de/modules/new...php?storyid=184</a> (site might
be down, quite a lot of people are reading this).</em></p>
<p>In case you don&rsquo;t speak german (just as this hacker), I&rsquo;ve tried a
little translation to english. I might have made some spelling errors,
but the original spelling wasn&rsquo;t perfect either. The guy really said
&ldquo;buy buy&rdquo; in the german version. I&rsquo;ve posted this on the forum on
<a href="http://www.desertcombat.com">http://www.desertcombat.com</a> before, so if this looks familiar, might
be the same. I&rsquo;ve corrected some mistakes and put the &lt;&gt; back to the
right version (The DC forum does not support them). All censoring was
done by this particular forum here. Notice that in germany we get DST
earlier than in the US.</p>
<p>The story starts (I&rsquo;m shortcutting here) with an [Please control your
cussing] insulting everyone on the IRC channel. Most people there
believed it was rather funny, but it got even more funny. For
information: The dangerous hacker is called bitchchecker and the one
being hacked and original author of the comments, who is talking here,
is known as Elch. 127.0.0.1 is always the IP-adress of the computer
you&rsquo;re currently using, any request there will return to your computer.</p>

hacker you are ^^ <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: tell me your network number man

</blockquote>
<p>What happened is clear: That guy entered his own IP-Adress in his mighty
Hack-Tool and crashed his own PC. This way, the attack on my PC was a
failure. I was already starting to think that I did not have to worry,
but a good hacker never calls it a day. Two minutes later he returned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-b5cd558e.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined
#stopHipHop <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: dude be happy my pc crashed otherwise
you&rsquo;d be gone <strong>metanot</strong>: lol <strong>elch</strong>: bitchchecker: Then try
hacking me again&hellip; I still have the same IP: 127.0.0.1
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: you&rsquo;re so stupid man <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: say buy buy
<strong>metanot</strong>: ah, [Please control your cussing] off <strong>bitchchecker</strong>:
buy buy elch * bitchchecker (~java@euirc-b5cd558e.dip.t-dialin.net)
Quit (Ping timeout#)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a tension in the room&hellip; Would he manage, after these two
failures, to crash my PC? I waited. Nothing happened. I felt relieve&hellip;
Six minutes passed by until he prepared the next wave of attack. Being a
Hacker, who usually cracks whole data centers, he knew what his problem
was now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-9ff3c180.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined
#stopHipHop <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: elch you son of a bitch <strong>metanot</strong>:
bitchchecker how old are you? <strong>elch</strong>: What&rsquo;s up bitchchecker?
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: you have a frie wal <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: fire wall
<strong>elch</strong>: maybe, i don&rsquo;t know <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: i&rsquo;m 26 <strong>metanot</strong>:
such behaviour with 26? <strong>elch</strong>: how did you find out that I have a
firewall? <strong>metanot</strong>: tststs this is not very nice missy
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: because your gay fire wall directed my turn off
signal back to me <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: be a man turn that shit off
<strong>elch</strong>: cool, didn&rsquo;t know this was possible. <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: thn
my virus destroys your pc man <strong>metanot</strong>: are you hacking yourselves?
<strong>elch</strong>: yes bitchchecker is trying to hack me <strong>metanot</strong>: he
bitchchecker if you&rsquo;re a hacker you have to get around a firewall even
i can do that <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: yes man i hack the elch but the sucker
has a fire wall the <strong>metanot</strong>: what firewall do you have?
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: like a girl <strong>metanot</strong>: firewall is normal a normal
hacker has to be able to get past it&hellip;you girl^^ <strong>he</strong>: Bitch give
yourself a jackson and chill you&rsquo;re letting them provoce you and give
those little girls new material all the time <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: turn
the firewall off then i send you a virus [Please control your
cussing]er <strong>elch</strong>: Noo <strong>metanot</strong>: he bitchchecker why turn it
off, you should turn it off <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: you&rsquo;re afraid
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: i don&rsquo;t wanna hack like this if he hides like a girl
behind a fire wall <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: elch turn off your shit wall!
<strong>metanot</strong>: i wanted to say something about this, do you know the
definition of hacking??? if he turns of the firewall that&rsquo;s an
invitation and that has nothing to do with hacking <strong>bitchchecker</strong>:
shut up <strong>metanot</strong>: lol <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: my grandma surfs with fire
wall <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: and you suckers think you&rsquo;re cool and don&rsquo;t
dare going into the internet without a fire wall</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He calls me girly and says only his grandma would use a firewall. I know
that elder people are much more intelligent then younger, but I couldn&rsquo;t
let that rest. To see whether he really is a good hacker I lie and let
everything as it is. I don&rsquo;t have a firewall at all, only my router.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>elch</strong>: bitchchecker, a collegue showed me how to turn the firewall
off. Now you can try again <strong>metanot</strong>: bitchhacker can&rsquo;t hack &gt; nice
play on words ^^ <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: wort man <strong>elch</strong>: bitchchecker:
I&rsquo;m still waiting for your attack! <strong>metanot</strong>: how many times again
he is no hacker <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: man do you want a virus
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: tell me your ip and it deletes your hard drive
<strong>metanot</strong>: lol ne give it up i&rsquo;m a hacker myself and i know how
hackers behave and i can tell you 100.00% you&rsquo;re no hacker..^^
<strong>elch</strong>: 127.0.0.1 <strong>elch</strong>: it&rsquo;s easy <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: lolololol
you so stupid man you&rsquo;ll be gone <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: and are the first
files being deleted <strong>elch</strong>: mom&hellip; <strong>elch</strong>: i&rsquo;ll take a look</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In panic I started the Windows Explorer, my heart beating faster. Had I
under-estimated him?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bitchchecker</strong>: don&rsquo;t need to rescue you can&rsquo;t son of a bitch
<strong>elch</strong>: that&rsquo;s bad <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: elch you idiout your hard drive
g: is deleted <strong>elch</strong>: yes, there&rsquo;s nothing i can do about it
<strong>bitchchecker</strong>: and in 20 seconds f: is gone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, true, G: and F: were gone. Did I ever have them? Doesn&rsquo;t matter, I
did not have time to think, I was scared. bitchchecker was comforting me
with a music tip.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bitchchecker</strong>: tupac rules <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: elch you son of a
bitch your f: is gone and e: too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drive E:? Oh my god&hellip; All the games are there! And the vacation
pictures! I instantly take a look. Everything still there. But the
hacker said it was deleted&hellip;.</p>
<p>Or isn&rsquo;t it happening on my computer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bitchchecker</strong>: and d: is at 45% you idiot lolololol <strong>he</strong>: why
doesn&rsquo;t meta say anything <strong>elch</strong>: he&rsquo;s probably rolling on the floor
laughing &gt; ^^ <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: your d: is gone <strong>he</strong>: go on BITCH</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guy is good: My CD-drive is allegedly deleted! Bitchchecker turned
my ancient disk sucker into a burner! But how did he do this? I&rsquo;ll have
to ask him. Some encourage him. He himself is giving advice how to avoid
the disaster on my hard drives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>bitchchecker</strong>: elch man you&rsquo;re so stupid never give your ip on the
internet <strong>bitchchecker</strong>: i&rsquo;m already at c: 30 percent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should I tell him he&rsquo;s not attacking my computer?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* bitchchecker (~java@euirc-9ff3c180.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping
timeout#)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too late&hellip; It&rsquo;s 20:22 when we get the last message of our hacker with
the alias &ldquo;bitchchecker&rdquo;. We see that he has a &ldquo;Ping timeout&rdquo;. We
haven&rsquo;t seen him since then&hellip; must be the Daylight Saving Time.</p>
