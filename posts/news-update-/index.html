            <article><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote anything, mostly due to a few new
changes that happened these last 3 weeks or so. Here&rsquo;s a small list of
some of the things that I can remember right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>My pet project
<a href="http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/">BillReminder</a> is now
hosted in the GNOME SVN repository! It took me a while to get the
right resources and free time to migrate everything, but I believe
that it is now completed. The source code can be checked out from
<a href="http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/billreminder/">here</a> and issues can be
filed in
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=billreminder">Bugzilla</a>.
There&rsquo;s also a new web site theme to go along with the changes,
courtesy of my good friend <a href="http://elyezer.com/">ElyÃ©zer Mendes
Rezend</a>e.</li>
<li>With the move to GNOME SVN I was (obviously) granted commit
access&hellip; and due to some schedule changes for the two current
committers for the Brazilian translation team, I have now been
performing translations reviews and commits. It is great to finally
be able to do this as I already have been doing this type of work
for the XFCE team.</li>
<li>Speaking of the XFCE team, I have been on top of the Brazilian
Portuguese translations and the next release (coming soon I&rsquo;m told)
will be <a href="http://i18n.xfce.org/stats/index.php?mode=4&amp;lang=trunk/pt_BR">100%
translated</a>!</li>
<li>I started attending one single class at the <a href="http://unc.edu">University of North
Carolina</a> (here in Chapel Hill) and this Tuesday was
my first day. The class, &ldquo;Database Design&rdquo;, is listed as a graduate
level class but so far it&rsquo;s been fairly easy to follow. As I already
have a bacchelors in BioChemistry, I&rsquo;m looking forward to taking
some bioinformatics classes in the near future.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve done some travelling these last 2 weeks. Two weekends ago we
went to the <a href="http://www.ncaquariums.com/ff/ffindex.htm">North Carolina
Aquarium</a> at Fort Fisher.
It was the first time I went to the Carolina beaches since I moved
here and it was a great experience! We took lots of pictures and
spent 2 great days soaking up in the sun!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Last weekend we went do Ocean City in Delaware to celebrate my
youngest&rsquo;s sister wedding. My whole family got together and rented a
nice house in a fancy complex with lots of activities. There was a
lot of swimming and drinking beer with my dad and older sister.
Every night we would go to where my younger sister was holding the
reception, a nice house by the lake with its own private pier! There
was a lot of drinking, eating, and the occasional fishing off the
pier! The evenings were amazing with a full moon and even some
fireworks (we don&rsquo;t know who was doing it, but it looked really
great from where we were). Needsless to say my kids loved it all!
Unfortunately we forgot our camera there and now I have to wait for
my sister to mail it back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I actually have more stuff but that will have to wait for an
upcoming post.</p>
